  "content": "# Day 76\n\nHoly shit. _What Is A Woman?_ was one of the best films I've seen in a while. I had no idea how large the incentives were for pharmaceutical companies to push transitioning on to young children. According to the film someone who transitions on average will pay 1.3 million dollars to pharma companies over the course of their life for all the surgeries and drugs that go into the process. I've always had strong libertarian values and the belief that people should be able to do what they want. The film did not change my opinion on that, but it did remind me how gross it is to push your beliefs onto young children and convince them they are ready to transition genders before they have been able to go through puberty. I've done plenty of dumb shit in my life, most of it during my teenage years. Adolescence can be challenging, but taking puberty blockers (which turn out to be the same drugs they give to pedophiles to chemically castrate them) seems like a wild way to make it better. A big part of the problem stems from the online communities that groom children to transition. Again, when people are adults they can make whatever choices they want. As a soon-to-be parent, I will do everything in my power to help my kid navigate their adolescence and remind them that transitioning genders is not going to solve any problems. Playing dress-up or doing things outside your normal gender roles is one thing. Experimental surgeries and drugs as an adolescent is a whole other thing that is nearly guaranteed to have harmful effects on the child. Wild this is considered a transphobic view by some. Shoutout to Matt Walsh for helping many realize the corrupt incentive structures that have convinced many professionals they are doing the right thing by telling kids that transitioning will make them happy. Life is full of pain and challenging yourself to achieve great things will make you happy. Not cutting off your God given genitials before you have become an adult and made a decision this is what you truly want.\n\nIt is honestly saddening to see how far these evil people are willing to go to indoctrinate kids. This past weekend there was an event in Dallas called Drag the kids to pride. What a nice sense of irony that name has since these parents are literally forcing ideologies on their kids they aren't ready to understand. This 2-minute [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q42RtI7bK3Y) sums it up pretty well. I have no problem with drag shows. I just don't think they are appropriate for an under 18 audience. Kids should not be in bars putting money in drag queens' underwear. If that is a transphobic take then so be it. I do not support young children being a part of this. Let them do what they want when they turn 18. I don't understand how the parents thought taking their small children to this event was okay.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*udC1-gJClsTMZt6c)\n\nAt least Twitter didn't miss with the artwork. Two people who had a big influence on gender ideology are [John Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money) and [Alfred Kinsey](https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/history/alfred-kinsey.php). _What Is A Woman?_ does a fantastic job pointing out the evil these doctors allowed to spread but after some quick google searches, they sure aren't painted in a bad light. Kinsey would literally record how many orgasms people had as part of his studies and yet they made a movie about the dude featuring Liam Neeson. Kind of want to watch it to see how they paint the guy. This [article](https://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/alfred-kinsey-a-brief-summary-and-critique/) from Alan Branch wasn't so kind to Kinsey. The dude who wrote it is a professor of Christian Ethics at Midwestern Baptist Theological which is important to note. Personally, I thought he did a great job pointing out some of the flaws with Kinsey's work like using prison inmates, many of whom were convicted sexual predators, as subjects for his studies. The whole idea behind gender ideology has become such a touchy topic, but it's important that people base things on reality. I don't want someone to feel less than because they identify as a woman even though they have a penis. That said many women are uncomfortable sharing a locker room with someone who has a penis. I don't know how to fix this, but I feel like there are legitimate concerns about this. Matt Walsh literally became a Virginia resident for a moment so he could speak out at a school board hearing. The reason he wanted to speak out is that someone who was [identifying as a transgender female ended up raping another female student](https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2021/october/va-judge-finds-transgender-teen-guilty-of-sexual-assault-in-loudoun-county-high-school-girls-bathroom-case) in the girl's locker room. Obviously, it is not fair to judge transgender people by one bad apple, but clearly, there has to be a better way to go about the bathroom thing. It is a very reasonable thing for women to be uncomfortable about someone with a penis sharing a locker room with them no matter how that person identifies. I don't have the answers I just want people to feel safe and comfortable. This includes trans people and women who want to only be among cis gendered females in the locker room. I hope as a nation we can start having conversations to address the problem based in reality, rather than labeling people transphobic who disagree that trans women should be granted 100% access to all women locker rooms.\n\nImportant to end these posts on a good note so I'm happy to announce I've made some solid progress on my Bitcoin Magazine article. Shout out Casey and the rest of the team over there for helping. Going to have my neighbor, who I just found out is a professional editor, take a look at it then I'm going to send it over to Bitcoin Magainze for some final reviews. I also got this yoda meme which I find hilarious.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*7RYm72oUX4yQpG_rGOQesA.jpeg)\n\nDoubt that is the actual reason, but who knows at this point. Wilder things have clearly happened.\n\n6/6/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
