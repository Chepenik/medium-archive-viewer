  "content": "# Day 828\n\nThe debate tonight was quite the spectacle. As someone who has never been a Trump enthusiast and doesn't believe politicians will save the day, I must say that Joe Biden is one of the most inept, dishonest, and incompetent Presidents I've ever witnessed. The United States deserves better. At this rate it does seem like Donald Trump is going to be the 47th President of the United States.\n\nI spent the evening watching the debate with my beloved Grandma, sharing a series of amusing memes from Twitter that we found hilarious together. It was delightful to laugh at these jokes side by side.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1806506858015801527](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1806506858015801527)](https://miro.medium.com/1*rBsA3CbPkWe-2YWGIm8FlQ.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1806509126932971963](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1806509126932971963)](https://miro.medium.com/1*YdWiKBgGnguWVlUOVgOqpg.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/patrickbetdavid/status/1806515126167646469](https://x.com/patrickbetdavid/status/1806515126167646469)](https://miro.medium.com/1*JlU6i7T7ETFTloAjjgwydg.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1806513184922100182](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1806513184922100182)](https://miro.medium.com/1*pCZ95M8iv2cwV_mwAQxZeg.png)\n\nI'll conclude with this because I believe it sums how many feel right now after watching this debate.\n\n![[https://x.com/Geiger_Capital/status/1806505906344956329](https://x.com/Geiger_Capital/status/1806505906344956329)](https://miro.medium.com/1*z226lOE8KqUuoeURb0WsCg.png)\n\nPolitics is a distraction, an entertaining one at least, so find what matters in life and spend more time focusing on that. You will be happier that way.\n\n6/27/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
