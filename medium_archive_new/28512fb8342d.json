  "content": "# Day 709\n\nHappy leap year! I was asked to put to bed my Daughter so I did then I ended up asleep. Came back out to write and read but man did I want to keep sleeping.\n\nI'm so blessed to be a Dad. That's it. That is the post. Procreate more. Have children. Believe me it will change your life for the better. 10x increase :)\n\n2/29/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
