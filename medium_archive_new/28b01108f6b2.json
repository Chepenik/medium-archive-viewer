Trying to convince an AI to become woke is a horrible idea. I understand there are plenty of touchy subjects people don't like discussing, but it's not like Grok will talk about genocide unless you prompt it to do so. So to post something like this under the guise of AI SaFeTy is so asinine in my opinion. Thus, I felt compelled to be a reply guy!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*IQmqYpOCJ10Wfnxi)\n\nSince I'm writing about topics that are seemingly banned in the West I might as well keep the train rolling. Here is Putin making a great point.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/LauraAboli_X/status/1736802466610688095%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nUsually I would feel compelled to say I'm not a Putin apologist, that Russia is bad, blah blah blah, but screw that. Putin is spot on. America is the greatest country on the planet and I believe that, but Putin is still stating facts here. To say otherwise means you are brainwashed and can't think critically. Democracy means that those you dislike have a chance at gaining power. Those currently in power are writing checks they cannot cash. If Trump is convicted, I predict things are going to get ugly, which is the last thing I want. This is why I hate to see elected leaders make a mockery of our democracy with the actions of a banana republic.\n\nFreedom of expression is a fundamental right, even if uncomfortable truths are spoken. Leaders who suppress dissent damage democracy. Yet citizens also have a duty to speak responsibility, with thoughtfulness and compassion. Comedy too plays a role, allowing us to laugh in dark times.\n\nBenjamin Franklin once said: \"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\" Ignore those who say otherwise. Healthy democracies thrive at their balance - where free speech coexists with caring communities. Where leaders are questioned, and where even harsh truths are shared constructively.\n\nMaintain your spirit against the adversities of the world. Life is a remarkable journey, and the United States is poised to rise from these challenging times stronger and more united. Comfort often leads to complacency, but fortunately, our current difficulties disrupt this complacency, propelling us forward with a whole new set of challenges. Good!ðŸ˜¤\n\n12/18/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
