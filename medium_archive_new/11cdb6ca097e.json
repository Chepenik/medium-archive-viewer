  "content": "# Day 392\n\nThis is going to be a short one because my eyes hurt from staring at screens all day.\n\nLight is everything. Get more sunlight if you want to be healthy. Not having sunlight is worse for you than smoking everyday.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-U26QAlfp9Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-U26QAlfp9Y&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-U26QAlfp9Y%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nThe comment section in that video is worth the scroll. It is quite hilarious.\n\nOn another note I did a great podcast today with Mike from River about The Blocksize Wars. Looking forward to getting that one out and having Mike back on to discuss The Book Of Satoshi next.\n\nFinally, walk more. Yes that is the advice. WALK MORE!\n\nSee you tomorrow anon for a longer post but for now my eyes hurt from staring at a screen all day.\n\n4/18/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
