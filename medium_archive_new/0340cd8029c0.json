Fast forward a few millennia, and we find ourselves in a world brimming with smartphones, smartwatches, and a seemingly infinite stream of digital content. Have we officially evolved from Homo sapiens to Techno sapiens? [Grimes seems to think so.](https://x.com/Philip_A_Gibson/status/1520251830655078400)\n\n**Embracing the Digital Age**\n\nFrom using shiny metals to now having peer-to-peer electronic cash, crypto has revolutionized our daily lives. Think about it: in school, didn't you have lockers? You were the only student who knew the code to your locker. What about FaceID on your iPhone? We have tools that can do magic based on biometrics. While we might not be cyborgs in the sense that the tech is inside us - well, not the majority of us anyway - we do have a hive mind. Thanks to a magical little genie in our pockets, we can order food directly to our doors using digital money, whether that be dollars, bitcoin, euros, or something else. It's amazing how much we use crypto and how powerful it makes the individual. Those who harness crypto - especially Bitcoin, the truest form of digital scarcity ever made - are tapping into a new kind of magic.\n\n**The Gadgeteer's Rise**\n\nRemember when discovering fire was a game-changer? Today, we have prosthetics controlled by thought and exoskeletons that enhance human capability. These advancements have moved from science fiction into reality, making everyday tasks easier and even providing superhero-like abilities. Wearable technology has become part of our daily lives. Our ancestors might have used sundials, but now our smartwatches monitor heart rates, track steps, and remind us to stand up during long workdays. It's like having a personal trainer that's always on call.\n\nI'm serious about these exoskeletons:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*7eqQRs0iMkicJJTp-lYwVg.png)\n\nI have one of these and it makes it so much easier to carry my daughter. I love it.\n\n**Cognitive Enhancements: Extra Bytes for Brain Power**\n\nCognitive enhancements are taking things to a new level. Neurotechnology companies like Neuralink have made brain-computer interfaces a possibility. Soon, you might be able to order pizza just by thinking about it. The potential applications are vast, from language learning to medical advancements. AR and VR technologies are also expanding our experiences. Who needs regular reality when you can interact with digital worlds, attend virtual meetings, or play immersive games? I kid. I don't want to live in a pod and eat bugs. That said, I do believe AR and VR will transform how we learn, work, and play, but it should not cancel out reality.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*BqGnWBb2Ji0zDHFltHoqBg.png)\n\n**Genetic Modifications and Biohacking**\n\nGenetic modifications through technologies like CRISPR are not just science fiction anymore. We can potentially eliminate genetic diseases and even enhance human capabilities. Biohackers are experimenting with DIY biology to push the boundaries of human performance.\n\n**Living in a Digital Society**\n\nOur society is increasingly digital. Virtual communities are now central to our social interactions. Ethical considerations about privacy, security, and human augmentation are more important than ever as we navigate this digital landscape. Hal Finney said it best:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*leR_dqE2uiBvui1f)\n\n**The Future**\n\nSo, have we evolved into Techno sapiens? I think so. Many professionals studying this field might say not quite yet, but it's hard to argue we aren't heading in that direction. The line between biological and technological is blurring. We are about to become cyborgs in an exponential evolution.\n\nThe future promises to be an exciting blend of biology and technology, pushing us to rethink what it means to be human. Those who embrace these advancements and continue exploring the endless possibilities of our digital evolution will probably fare better than those who reject it all. The journey from Homo sapiens to Techno sapiens is just beginning, and it's shaping up to be an intriguing ride. I hope we keep our shared humanity and figure out how to flourish with these new tools. I'm bullish we will because cryptography can shift the incentives toward cooperation rather than coerecion. Time will tell.\n\n5/17/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
