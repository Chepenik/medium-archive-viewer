  "content": "# Day 829\n\nToday, I fasted and then went on a 5-mile run. During my run, I listened to two journalists who, despite being on opposite sides of the political spectrum, share a genuine commitment to telling the truth.\n\n![[https://youtu.be/iyADwZrQFqE](https://youtu.be/iyADwZrQFqE)](https://miro.medium.com/1*UUBJBK_hGjcIFYFzVUxYgQ.png)\n\nThat really gives me hope. On the one hand, it's astonishing to witness the ruthless corruption of governments around the world, including the United States. I don't exactly enjoy watching the the modern-day fall of Rome collapse like a house of cards.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm ready for the moment when hard times create strong individuals. Good will always triumph over evil. Just think of how quickly a dark room fills with light the moment there's a flicker.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Prt3JShqP_Zkva10DyzMQg.png)\n\nIn journalism, working discreetly and letting stories speak for themselves is powerful. As in chess, strategic maneuvers unveil truths, resulting in impactful consequences that function as the ultimate checkmate against the deceptive propaganda of legacy corporate media. Real journalism is making a comeback because honesty will always prevail, even in a sea of deceptive lies.\n\n6/28/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
