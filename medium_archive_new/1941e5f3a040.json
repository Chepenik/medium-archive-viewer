  "content": "# Day 243\n\nMy girlfriend sent me a job listing for a farm helper position in Vermont. Would be a total change from what I've always done but that could be exciting. I'm going to reach out and see. Might be a bit of a long-shot since I don't have any experience but I have always believed in fate.\n\nI'm sure working on a farm is hard work but it seems like it would also be rewarding work. I do like Vermont and rural New England. The place is called Fat Sheep Farms and even if I don't get the position I'd love to visit one day. [https://www.fatsheepfarmvermont.com/](https://www.fatsheepfarmvermont.com/) They got a nice website check them out. My girl and I visited a nearby place called the Windsor Inn and fell in love with the area. Something so charming about New England's rural parts.\n\nOutside of that I've been cooking on my website. Straight Chef-Boy-Ar-Cee. Check it out at conorchepenik.com Don't have much more to write tonight because my eyes hurt but I'm proud of the meme section I made for my personal site. Also figured out how to accept forms without much friction. Onwards and upwards. Now I just need to finish Mass Adoption's site which is a challenge for tomorrow.\n\n11/20/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
