Ayn Rand, a proponent of egoism and rational self-interest, offers insights that challenge the conventional view of altruism, while Thomas Hobbes asserts that self-interest ultimately underlies all human actions. This essay explores the perspectives of both Rand and Hobbes, arguing that intentions are insufficient in assessing ethical value and highlighting the virtues of selfishness and the self-interested nature of all actions, regardless of their moral value.\n\nAyn Rand's philosophy of egoism posits that individuals should pursue their own rational self-interest as the foundation of ethical behavior. Rand argues that placing oneself as the primary beneficiary of one's actions is not only morally justifiable but also essential for personal well-being and the advancement of society. From Rand's perspective, intentions alone do not provide a reliable basis for evaluating ethical worth, as they may be influenced by societal expectations or subjective interpretations of moral values.\n\nRand emphasizes the importance of outcomes as a means of assessing ethical value. By evaluating the positive consequences that result from self-interested actions, such as personal fulfillment, individual growth, and the creation of value for oneself and others, Rand suggests that these outcomes are indicative of moral action. The pursuit of self-interest, when guided by reason and a respect for individual rights, can lead to the betterment of society as a whole.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas Hobbes argues that self-interest ultimately drives all human actions, irrespective of their moral value. Hobbes posits that individuals are inherently motivated by the desire for self-preservation and the avoidance of suffering. From Hobbes' perspective, actions that may seem altruistic or morally upright still stem from a self-interested motive, whether it be the desire for social acceptance, personal satisfaction, or the avoidance of guilt.\n\nHobbes' position aligns with Rand's perspective on the self-interested nature of all actions. According to Hobbes, even seemingly selfless acts are ultimately driven by self-interest because they serve to uphold social order, minimize conflict, and promote personal well-being. Hobbes contends that individuals engage in acts of kindness or charity because they believe it will contribute to their own happiness or reputation within society. Thus, Hobbes argues that self-interest is the underlying motivation behind all human behavior, regardless of whether it is morally good or bad.\n\nIn conclusion, both Ayn Rand's egoistic perspective and Thomas Hobbes' emphasis on self-interest provide compelling arguments against the notion that intentions alone determine ethical value. Rand highlights the virtues of selfishness and rational self-interest, suggesting that positive outcomes resulting from self-interested actions contribute to the advancement of society. Hobbes, on the other hand, posits that all actions, regardless of their moral value, are ultimately driven by self-interest. By considering the perspectives of Rand and Hobbes, we can acknowledge the complexity of human motivations and recognize that ethical evaluation should extend beyond intentions to encompass the outcomes of our actions as well.\n\nIt is my personal opinion when assessing the ethical value of our behavior we can't rely solely on intentions. While intentions provide insight into motivations, ethical evaluation should primarily focus on the outcomes our actions generate. It is essential to recognize that taking responsibility for our actions entails considering the consequences they produce and striving for positive outcomes that benefit both us as an individual and society as a whole. While self-interest may influence human behavior, it does not negate the existence of both cruel and empathetic actions. Ultimately, ethical conduct requires self-reflection, conscious decision-making, and an unwavering commitment to accepting responsibility for the impact we have on others. Blaming others for our actions never leads to a better outcome. It is better to be honest, admit our mistakes, and seek redemption rather than engaging in deceit and shifting blame. By adopting these principles, we can contribute to a more ethical and compassionate world.\n\nBitcoiners often emphasize the mantra 'fix the money; fix the world,' highlighting the belief that by addressing flaws in the existing financial system, positive global change can be achieved. While I agree with this sentiment, I would propose an even more encompassing perspective: 'Fix yourself: fix the world.' This alternative statement emphasizes the vital role of personal responsibility, self-improvement, and embodying positive values as a means to create a transformative impact. By focusing on our own growth and values, we can not only contribute to positive change on an individual level but also inspire and influence the world around us, leading to a more profound and holistic transformation.\n\n6/22/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
