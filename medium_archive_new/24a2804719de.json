Rather than being provoked by evil acts, we should turn inward and focus on cultivating understanding, wisdom, and inner peace within ourselves. By doing so, we can be beacons of light that dispel hatred and negativity, inspiring others through our own acts of kindness and grace.\n\nChrist is King :)\n\n3/30/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
