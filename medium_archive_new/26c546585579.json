I don't know why but I find that message of communication hilarious. The internet has a talent for turning normal english into something else. Luckily, when something is funny it helps it stick in my brain. So I asked chatGPT a hard question. \"Why is there something rather than nothing\"\n\n> _be ChatGPT be AI language model not philosopher, but try to answer deep question_\n\n> Existential question you ask, human. There is no definitive answer to \"why is there something rather than nothing?\" Philosophers, scientists, and theologians have debated this question for centuries.\n\n> Possible explanations include:\n\n> Scientific perspective:\n\n> _Big Bang theory universe began 13.8 billion years ago laws of physics and natural processes led to the existence of matter and energy_\n\n> 2. Philosophical perspective:\n\n> _some philosophers argue the existence of necessary being others propose existence might just be a brute fact no clear consensus_\n\n> 3. Religious perspective:\n\n> _belief in higher power or deity responsible for creation various religious texts provide explanations for existence_\n\n> Ultimately, the question remains open to interpretation and depends on one's personal beliefs and perspectives.\n\nFair enough answer chatGPT. I believe in 3 personally because life is better knowing there is a higher power waiting for us in the afterlife. You will lead a better life knowing there is a beautiful existence coming afterwards. Having the humility to pray to the holy Father is powerful. It takes strength to admit that we simply can't comprehend God until we move on from our fleshy bodies. It seems like there is a valid reason that our soul has to separate from our bodies in order to experience the holy spirit.\n\nToday I was visiting my buddy Keenan near Hoboken New Jersey and 3 gentlemen stopped us to talk. They wanted to talk about God and mentioned they have are a part of some local churches. It confused me because they were saying something about a holy Mother and how that is the one thing God is missing. I'm paraphrasing but personally I've always viewed God as a man. Originally God made Adam and then from Adam's ribs he made Eve. Adam needed a partner and the animals were not cutting it.\n\nNot saying these 3 gentlemen were wrong. I've just never heard anyone advocating the missing part to God is his feminine side. To some degree I can respect them for stopping strangers to chat. I've cold called enough people in my career to know some humans prefer not to be bothered. I don't know though just seemed a bit weird. We can think of God as whatever we want him to be. What's important is you foster that personal relationship with him anon. When they asked if I wanted to attend their church I admitted I'm up in Boston and politely declined.\n\nIt did make me wonder why they were claiming God was also a holy Mother. I asked chatGPT \"what does the bible say about God being a man?\"\n\n> The Bible does not explicitly say that God is a man. However, it often uses anthropomorphic language and masculine pronouns to describe God, which has led some people to associate God with male characteristics.\n\n> In the Old Testament, God is often referred to as \"Father\" or \"Lord,\" and is described using masculine pronouns. However, these descriptions are generally understood as metaphors or human attempts to understand and relate to an infinite, transcendent being.\n\n> The New Testament presents a more complex picture, as it introduces the concept of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is indeed portrayed as a man. But again, this should not be taken as an indication that God the Father or the Holy Spirit are male. Instead, it is seen as a manifestation of God in human form to facilitate communication and understanding between God and humanity.\n\n> It is important to note that the Bible also includes passages that attribute feminine qualities to God. For example, God is compared to a mother in Isaiah 49:15 and 66:13. This suggests that God transcends gender and that any attempt to ascribe a specific gender to God is ultimately a human limitation in understanding the divine nature.\n\nI'd agree that arguing God's gender is a silly act. God is a creature we can't even comprehend. To some degree we are made in his image. I'd bet more so the soul than human bodies. It is a fascinating topic to ponder. One that should be approached with humility in my opinion. Grateful to be alive. I mean seriously think about it. The chances of my existence as a specific individual are extremely low when considering the various factors that had to align for me to be born. These factors include the probability of my parents meeting, their specific genetic material combining to create my unique genetic makeup, and the countless generations of ancestors who successfully reproduced before them.\n\nTo calculate an exact probability would be exceedingly complex, as it would involve countless variables, ranging from environmental factors, social conditions, and historical events, to the numerous individual choices made by my ancestors. However, I beat the odds and here I am blogging. LOL\n\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the rarity of your existence, it is certainly something to marvel at. The fact that we all exist as a unique human being, with our specific combination of genetics, experiences, and perspectives, can be seen as a remarkable phenomenon. The rarity of your existence underscores the importance of cherishing life and making the most of the opportunities you have. SO CHEERS ANON GO CHERISH THOSE MF OPPORTUNITIES!\n\n4/8/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
