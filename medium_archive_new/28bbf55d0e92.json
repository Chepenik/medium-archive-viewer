She was being quite fussy, and after 10 minutes of non-stop whining, I decided to try a different approach. Instead of getting frustrated or demanding she calm down, I began to softly repeat:\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of you.\"\n\n\"I know you're going to do amazing things with your life.\"\n\nI must have repeated these phrases about 10 times with slight variations while gently rubbing her back. Amazingly, she quickly stopped crying and fell asleep within just two minutes.\n\nWords matter immensely, especially to children. As a parents it is so easy to underestimate the impact our words have on children. In moments of frustration or exhaustion, it's easy to forget that children are acutely attuned to our emotions and the way we communicate with them.\n\nBy choosing to respond with love, patience, and positive affirmations, we not only help soothe their immediate distress but also contribute to their long-term emotional well-being. These moments of connection build trust, security, and self-esteem that can last a lifetime. The most effective parenting tools are the simplest: love, reassurance, and a gentle presence. Next time I get frustrated with my child I need to remember my own words.\n\nGrateful for everything the Lord has blessed with me. Thank you God.\n\n![Generated with chatGPT's DALLE](https://miro.medium.com/1*iL009EktpcUKWSI2tro-tA.png)\n\n7/11/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
