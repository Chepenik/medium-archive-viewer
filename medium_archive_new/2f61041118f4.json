I must appear so focused to her as I constantly have to remind her to give me space. Yet, she remains captivated by the process and these shared creative moment are truly special. I'm deeply grateful I get to share those moments with you Sloan.\n\nIt will be fascinating to watch her grow and discover her own passions. I'm excited to see her become an amazing artist, coder, athlete, musician, etc. Whatever path she decides to take.\n\nBeing a parent is profoundly rewarding. I hope to share what I know and help her avoid pitfalls, yet I recognize that mistakes often become our best teachers when experienced firsthand. As a parent, I must carefully weigh which lessons to teach directly and which to let her discover on her own, a delicate balance I'm committed to navigating.\n\n:)\n\n3/11/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
