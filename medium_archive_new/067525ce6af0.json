  "content": "# Day 596\n\nSocial media is engineered to provoke negative emotions - annoyance, irritation, even anger. These reactions keep users scrolling and engaged. I try to counter this by following more positive voices, with mixed results. Yet despite the frequent negativity, social media occasionally elicits a profound emotional response in me. Today a post was able to cut through the noise and bring me to tears.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/CaliforniaFrizz/status/1722231668025774463%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI wanted to link to the actual tweet I saw but here is the full thing written out below.\n\nKatharine Hepburn's childhood, in her own words. \"Once when I was a teenager, my father and I were standing in line to buy tickets for the circus. Finally, there was only one other family between us and the ticket counter. This family made a big impression on me. There were eight children, all probably under the age of 12. The way they were dressed, you could tell they didn't have a lot of money, but their clothes were neat and clean. The children were well-behaved, all of them standing in line, two-by-two behind their parents, holding hands. They were excitedly jabbering about the clowns, animals, and all the acts they would be seeing that night. By their excitement you could sense they had never been to the circus before. It would be a highlight of their lives. The father and mother were at the head of the pack standing proud as could be. The mother was holding her husband's hand, looking up at him as if to say, \"You're my knight in shining armour.\" He was smiling and enjoying seeing his family happy. The ticket lady asked the man how many tickets he wanted? He proudly responded, \"I'd like to buy eight children's tickets and two adult tickets, so I can take my family to the circus.\" The ticket lady stated the price. The man's wife let go of his hand, her head dropped, the man's lip began to quiver. Then he leaned a little closer and asked, \"How much did you say?\" The ticket lady again stated the price. The man didn't have enough money. How was he supposed to turn and tell his eight kids that he didn't have enough money to take them to the circus? Seeing what was going on, my dad reached into his pocket, pulled out a $20 bill, and then dropped it on the ground. (We were not wealthy in any sense of the word!) My father bent down, picked up the $20 bill, tapped the man on the shoulder and said, \"Excuse me, sir, this fell out of your pocket.\" The man understood what was going on. He wasn't begging for a handout but certainly appreciated the help in a desperate, heartbreaking and embarrassing situation. He looked straight into my dad's eyes, took my dad's hand in both of his, squeezed tightly onto the $20 bill, and with his lip quivering and a tear streaming down his cheek, he replied; \"Thank you, thank you, sir. This really means a lot to me and my family.\" My father and I went back to our car and drove home. The $20 that my dad gave away is what we were going to buy our own tickets with. Although we didn't get to see the circus that night, we both felt a joy inside us that was far greater than seeing the circus could ever provide. That day I learnt the value to Give. The Giver is bigger than the Receiver. If you want to be large, larger than life, learn to Give. Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get - only with what you are expecting to give - which is everything. The importance of giving, blessing others can never be over emphasized because there's always joy in giving. Learn to make someone happy by acts of giving.\"\n\nIt is true. With the caveat that people feel good when they give based on their own free will. When I pay taxes, I'm complying to avoid the consequences of men with guns at my door demanding jail or payment. It's not a willing gift, but an obligation I meet to stay out of legal trouble. True giving comes from the heart, not legal mandate.\n\nThe narrative shared by Katharine Hepburn from her childhood is a touching reminder that the core of true happiness lies within the realm of heartfelt generosity and the warmth of love, rather than in the realm of physical wealth. The story serves as a powerful parable, imparting the lesson that it is through our support for one another, particularly in times of trial, that hope and significance are kindled. This lesson showcases that character is not simply a fair-weather trait but is instead truly defined and tested in adversity. The story Hepburn shares is a testament to the profound impact of compassion and the enduring connections of family. It demonstrates that our acts of kindness, no matter how small or seemingly inconsequential, have the potential to cast long shadows of light in others' lives, affirming our collective human spirit.\n\nIn today's digital age, the enchantment of a circus - once a bastion of wonder - may not captivate the young as it once did. The glow of smartphones often outshines the spotlight of the circus ring, as virtual experiences vie for attention against the tangible. This shift is astonishing, underscoring the profound changes in how today's youth engage with the world around them. It's a development that evokes a sense of loss for the simple joys of yesteryear, yet it also opens up a dialogue about the evolving nature of entertainment and connection. The challenge and opportunity lie in finding balance - fostering an appreciation for the irreplaceable magic of live experiences without dismissing the value that technology can bring to our lives.\n\nFor example, I was moved by this tweet, online, I used chatGPT and Claude to help me improve this Medium, and then I generated the image below with AI. Which is all great, but also now I'm going to go spend time with my family because as I type this I realize tangible real life is important.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*qrRkVWdiCRG3tr7Q)\n\nIt is a fine line balancing between real life and digital life. Here is an attempt at something which threads that line.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FRBLQEH1gGG0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRBLQEH1gGG0&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FRBLQEH1gGG0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n11/8/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
