  "content": "# Day 843\n\n![A liberal and a conservate having great conversation because they realize there are way more important things than their political opinions](https://miro.medium.com/1*BaPkZXMJnKtQZ0cVpL2CQQ.png)\n\nI recently had a phone call with a college friend that left me feeling both refreshed and reflective. Although we align differently on the political spectrum - she leans left while I lean slightly right - I hesitate to even mention these labels. Political affiliations are not particularly significant to either of us, and I tend to avoid discussing politics. However, I bring it up here to emphasize an important point: regardless of political ideology, we often share much more in common with those across the aisle than we might initially think.\n\nOur conversation meandered through a diverse landscape of topics: money, AI, food, ethics, war, and technology. We found ourselves equally disturbed by the tragic images of children being bombed in Palestine and soldiers from both Ukraine & Russia who are losing their lives to exploding drones. Hard to believe we can watch this live 24/7/365 if we want. We pondered the double-edged sword of social media and its profound impact on society.\n\nWhat struck me most was not our agreements or disagreements, but the quality of our exchange. We listened, learned, and enhanced each other's perspectives, all while enjoying the simple pleasure of reconnecting with an old friend. Despite our supposed political differences, we found common ground on numerous issues and shared many of the same concerns about the world.\n\nThis experience highlighted a crucial point: the \"divide and conquer\" strategies prevalent in today's political discourse are nothing more than a distraction. They pull our focus away from what truly matters: our shared humanity and the real issues that affect us all.\n\nIn a world that often seems intent on categorizing people into opposing camps, my conversation served as a powerful reminder. When we set aside labels and engage in genuine dialogue, we often discover that we have more in common than we thought. We are not defined by our political leanings but by our capacity for empathy, understanding, and mutual respect.\n\nUltimately, there are only two teams that matter: team humanity and team anti-humanity. By fostering open, respectful conversations across perceived divides, we take a stand for humanity. We reject the artificial boundaries that separate us and embrace the shared experiences and values that unite us.\n\nLet this be a call to action: reach out to someone you perceive as different from you, perhaps even someone on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Engage in a real conversation. You might be surprised by how much you have in common and how much you can learn from each other. In doing so, we can begin to heal the divisions that threaten to tear us apart and focus on the challenges and opportunities that we all face together, regardless of our political affiliations.\n\n*Politicians do not approve of this message*\n\n7/12/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
