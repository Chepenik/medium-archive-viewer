  "content": "# Day 818\n\nI got so lost trying to code tonight I almost forgot to write my Medium.\n\nAs I laid in Bed I sprang up and came to write this.\n\nI want to keep this streak going of writing every day for the rest of my life. (Please don't go out of business, ever, Medium). I'm more proud of this writing streak than I ever was a Duolingo streak.\n\nI love writing whether it's code, articles, reviews, comments, and everything in between.\n\nCAN'T STOP WON'T STOP.\n\nHave more good habits and less bad ones and over the course of life if you can keep the good to bad around 51% well you will be alright.\n\n6/17/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
