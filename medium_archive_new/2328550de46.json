  "content": "# Day 26\n\nAhhhhhhh Easter Sunday. Grateful to be able to celebrate this holiday with people I love. Played 18 this morning and had two pars. I'm still trying to break 100 so this was a good day in my book. Golf can be infuriating but at the same time, it can be great. Like most things in life, it's about your mindset and attitude. Next time you're on the course anon, take a deep breath and appreciate the fact you are in nature. As I drove home from the course with George and Connor, my golf partners for today, I was struck by the beauty of the homes we passed. New Jersey gets a bad rap but it's lowkey stunning outside of Newark and the landfills. Not sure where I'll end up when I move away from the city but if I found a good spot I wouldn't hate New Jersey.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*R_z5DsFzJ5JYlOF7smPIng.jpeg)\n\nEverything in the above meme seems like a pretty sure-fire way to happiness. If you look at this chart and think wtf you have likely been Psy-Oped. Luckily, you have come to a bitcoin maxi's medium so I recommend reading my previous posts and also taking everything you see online with a grain of salt. The internet is like golf. It can be both incredible and infuriating depending on your experience. At least with Golf you can look around, and unless you're on an absolute hogback of a course, cherish your surroundings. Little harder to do with the internet if you don't know where to find the dank memes.\n\nStay safe out there anon <3\n\n4/17/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
