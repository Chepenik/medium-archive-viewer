It's not my usual reading material, but shout out my boy Travis for giving me the book. Long was Louisiana's governor and senator in the 1930s, a populist who built roads and hospitals for the poor while simultaneously constructing one of the most effective state-level dictatorships in American history. His story isn't just historical curiosity. It's a blueprint for understanding how power corrupts and why we need systems that don't depend on human virtue.\n\n**The Machine Long Built**\n\nLong didn't just win elections with populist rhetoric, he captured every enforcement and resource-allocation mechanism in Louisiana. He controlled 10,000+ state jobs, stacked courts with loyalists, commanded police who harassed opponents, and weaponized tax assessors to destroy enemies financially. Every bridge built, every contract awarded, every job filled became a political instrument.\n\nThe effectiveness was undeniable. Free textbooks appeared in schools. Roads connected rural areas previously isolated. Hospitals served people who'd never had access to healthcare. LSU expanded dramatically. These were more than just propaganda victories for long, they were tangible improvements in material conditions.\n\nBut they resulted in continuous expansion of his power apparatus. Each program justified more control, more patronage, more institutional capture. The benefits were real and so was the grift. Thus, they became the fuel for Long's authoritarian consolidation of power in Lousiana.\n\n**The Pattern: Diagnosis, Solution, Replication**\n\nLong correctly identified that Louisiana's elite was extractive and parasitic. Standard Oil did rig the system. The poor were systematically exploited. His diagnosis was accurate.\n\nHis solution was replacing distributed oligarchic control with centralized personal control. He eliminated checks not because they were corrupt (though they were), but because they constrained him. This is the autocrat's consistent pattern:\n\n1. Correctly identify system dysfunction\n\n2. Use it as mandate for removing limitations on personal power\n\n3. Replicate the exploitation under new management\n\nThe oligarchy he fought survived him because it was distributed, impersonal, embedded in property relations and legal structures. His machine was him. When he was murdered in 1935, it fragmented immediately. Personal autocracy dies with the person.\n\n**Corruption Isn't the Exception: It's the Operating System Of Politics**\n\nAfter Long's death, his machine splintered. His successor as governor went to federal prison for turning it into pure graft. His brother Earl inherited fragments and eventually had a public mental breakdown while in office. The system operated almost autonomously, carrying a non-functional governor because the patronage networks had institutional momentum.\n\nWhen the Anti-Long faction finally gained power, they didn't dismantle the centralized apparatus. They redirected it. This is standard: opposition to autocratic power evaporates when the opposition gains access to that power.\n\nMost of Long's authoritarian provisions weren't repealed, they became normal. Subsequent governors couldn't imagine operating without them. That's autocracy's persistent effect: it resets the baseline of acceptable power concentration.\n\n**The Incentive Problem**\n\nLong demonstrated something fundamental: humans optimize for their incentives within whatever system they inhabit. Give someone control over jobs, contracts, law enforcement, and courts, and they will use that control to maintain and expand their position. This isn't a moral failing unique to Long, it's just predictable behavior if you look at the incentives.\n\nThe reformers who replaced him faced identical incentives and made similar choices. The difference was competence and vision, not virtue.\n\nTo Long's credit, the man could talk. According to _Kingfish_, he set a record for filibustering in the Senate for 15 hours straight by reading recipes, explaining pot liquor, holding the floor through pure endurance and charisma. He was exceptionally gifted at persuasion and performance. But that's precisely the problem: his effectiveness came from personal capability, not systemic design. When the exceptional person disappears, the system fails.\n\nThe reality is that every political system concentrating power in individuals or small groups eventually produces this outcome. The timeframe varies. The specific mechanisms differ. The result is consistent: power concentrates until external force disrupts it or the system collapses.\n\n**Protocols Over People**\n\nThis is why protocol-based systems matter. Bitcoin doesn't depend on Satoshi Nakamoto's virtue. It operates according to mathematical rules that no individual or group can unilaterally alter. The protocol is the system. There's no equivalent to capturing the legislature or stacking the courts.\n\nNostr doesn't require trusting relay operators or platform owners. The protocol enables communication without centralized control points. If one relay censors, users route around it costlessly.\n\nThese systems are not utopian fantasies, they are live protocols. I love to see people engineering solutions to the human incentive problem. We should accept that people will optimize for self-interest and design systems where self-interested behavior produces neutral or beneficial outcomes rather than exploitation.\n\nTraditional governance assumes virtuous leaders or effective oversight. History suggests this assumption is wrong. Long wasn't uniquely evil, he was normal human behavior under concentrated power incentives. The problem is the concentration, not the individual.\n\n**The Structural Alternative**\n\nDistributed, protocol-based systems can't eliminate all human conflict or solve every coordination problem. But they remove the primary failure mode: the ability of individuals or coalitions to capture the system's control points and redirect it toward extraction.\n\nLong needed to control the legislature, courts, police, and patronage simultaneously. Remove any one channel and the system destabilizes. Protocol-based systems don't have those channels. There's no equivalent to intimidating judges or firing dissident employees.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain continues regardless of who operates nodes. The network routes around damaged infrastructure. The protocol enforces rules without human discretion. These properties make certain kinds of corruption mechanically impossible rather than merely illegal.\n\n**Implementation Over Idealism**\n\nThis isn't about eliminating government or pretending protocols solve all problems. Sadly, protocols are not a perfect panacea for the wet dream panopticon the globalist filth want to create. But they are a start to fighting back against this tyranny. It's about recognizing which problems protocols solve better than human institutions such as currency manipulation, censorship, and other single points of failure capture by concentrated interests.\n\nLong's machine delivered real benefits but required totalitarian control to sustain them. Protocol-based systems can deliver specific benefits (censorship-resistant communication, inflation-resistant value storage, permissionless financial transactions) without requiring anyone to trust in human virtue or oversight effectiveness. Bitcoin relies on human greed to provide perfect money to the world and that is why it works so well. I mean just look at this chart and seriously ask yourself in 10 years what will it look like?\n\n![Hint: UP AND TO THE RIGHT!](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZCEeUYkgrnYXL3jsEY5Mrg.png)\n\nThe question isn't whether humans are good or bad. The question is what systems channel human behavior toward beneficial outcomes without depending on virtue. Long's story is a reminder that building those systems matters more than finding better people to run traditional ones.\n\nEvery patronage job Long controlled was a potential extraction point. Every gubernatorial appointment was a capture opportunity. Every discretionary decision was a corruption vector. Protocols eliminate much of that discretion. That's not a bug, it's the foundational feature of outsourcing these things to protocols instead of people.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\n_Kingfish_ is worth reading not because Long was uniquely terrible, but because he was uniquely capable while being structurally normal. He responded predictably to the incentive structure Louisiana's political system created. Thousands of other politicians faced similar structures and made similar choices, just less effectively.\n\nThe lesson isn't that we need better politicians. The lesson is that we need systems where politician quality is irrelevant to operational integrity. That's what protocols provide: systematic integrity independent of human virtue.\n\nLong built a machine that delivered schools and hospitals while crushing opposition. It died with him because it was him. Protocols don't die with their creators. They persist because the system is the protocol, not the people operating it.\n\nSatoshi built something different. A system where the rules execute mathematically instead of through governors with patronage armies. Where nobody needs permission to participate and nobody has discretionary power to exclude others. Where the ledger updates according to consensus rules, not political convenience.\n\nLong needed totalitarian control to deliver benefits. Bitcoin delivers benefits because control is impossible. It's a fundamentally different architecture for coordinating human behavior. The code is live. The network runs. The question is whether we build on it or keep pretending the next charismatic leader will be the virtuous one. Hint: HE WON'T! Save yourself because no one is coming to do it for you.\n\n9/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
