  "content": "# Day 1217\n\nI need to write an op-ed on Bitcoin as digital gold so today I'm just going to brain dump my thoughts. So it here goes.\n\nWhy does digital gold make serve as a useful analogy for Bitcoin? Well because both are beautiful in their own ways. For gold I don't need to explain why it's beautiful. People wear it as jewelry, if they are rich enough they decorate their home and businesses with it. It sparkles and is just genuinely a good locking rock. Bitcoin is beautiful software. The memes that Bitcoiners produce are gold, it has a cool logo that had gold in the original design, go figure, and it brings out the best in most people (and the worst in those who don't like sound money).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*BKIRVK-tu1PVUtxS.jpg)\n\nNow the logo is more orange, but still the same B and it still looks great. All the different softwares out there that let you use Bitcoin, well some are really well done and make using the protocol seamless. So a long winded way of saying all the aesthetics surrounding freedom money are great. This is not the case with fiat, no matter how much the Fed pays to renovate their private bank which gets all the benefits of being private, plus protection from the government in the worst ways possible, for the consumer of course, not the Fed.\n\nSome other reasons, they are both scarce. Bitcoin is actually truly scarce. Gold supply only increases about 2% every year. They are both considered commodities as well. Gold a physical one and Bitcoin a digital one.\n\nBoth limit government spending. The gold standard was far from perfect, and pricing gold at a fixed price, is well...fiat in itself, but we had to go off a gold standard because people were calling the US' bluff for printing too much money which caused other countries to realize we did not have enough gold.\n\nOk solid brain dump. Now it's time to cook the gold bugs with Claude (the below text is a combo of AI generation and fun editing by me, but know deep down I still love gold and have a lot more respect for gold bugs than I do fiat maxis. I just like having fun after some brain dumping. My real article will look a lot different than this brain dump session.\n\n**Bitcoin as Digital Gold: A Schizo's Guide to Why Boomer Rocks Can't Compete**\n\n> _be me\n writing about digital gold vs physical rocks\n realize I'm about to trigger every gold bug on earth\n feelsgoodman.jpeg_\n\n**The Aesthetic Supremacy Pill**\n\nLook anon, here's the thing about beauty that goldbugs will never understand: **Bitcoin is literally more beautiful than their shiny rocks.**\n\nGold? Sure, it's pretty. Your wife's jewelry, some oligarch's toilet seat, whatever. But it's static beauty: dead, inert, unchanging. It just sits there like a glittering paperweight while empires rise and fall around it.\n\nBitcoin? This is **living digital beauty.** Every transaction is a brushstroke on the blockchain canvas. The mathematical elegance of SHA-256 hashing is poetry in motion. The orange glow of the logo isn't just branding, it's the digital sunrise of monetary revolution. When you see that ₿ symbol, your neurons fire in ways that Peter Schiff's brain literally cannot comprehend because he's hardwired for caveman-tier \"shiny rock good\" thinking.\n\nThe memes alone are worth more than most gold ETFs. Have you seen the laser eyes movement? That's aesthetic coordination on a global scale that gold has never and will never achieve. Gold bugs make boomer comics about \"dollar collapse\" Bitcoiners create art that moves markets and changes minds.\n\n**What Digital Gold Actually Means (For Non-Boomers)**\n\nDigital gold isn't just \"gold but on computer\", it's gold **perfected through technology:**\n\n**Portability**: Gold bugs love to stroke their bars and coins. Cool story. I can carry a billion dollars of Bitcoin in my head via seed phrase. (If I only had 1 billion dollars of bitcoin...) Try memorizing your gold stash location after a boating accident.\n\n**Divisibility**: Want to buy coffee with gold? Better bring your microscope and chemistry set. Bitcoin divisible to 8 decimal places, enabling micropayments that make gold look like monetary stones from the Bronze Age. This is why gold needed a silver, but in crypto, there is no second best cryptocurrency.\n\n**Verifiability**: \"Is this real gold?\" requires expensive equipment and expertise. Bitcoin authenticity verification? Any 12-year-old with a computer can run a node and verify the entire monetary supply in real-time assuming they had based parents.\n\n**Censorship Resistance**: Government confiscates your gold stash? GG. Bitcoin private keys stored properly? Good luck confiscating mathematics, fed bois.\n\n**Why Gold \"Rallied\" This Year**\n\nGold went up almost 30% this year and goldbugs are doing victory laps. Meanwhile Bitcoin went up slightly less on the YTD chart while also becoming a priority for the new administration as well as setting records with the new ETFs that came out. \"Rat poison\" is taking over wall street.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*HpbERyqYBKcW3TxUjiBr6Q.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*K0rD6X5TWgAGBGss5IlW9w.png)\n\nGold's \"rally\" is mostly inflation hedging, scared money fleeing to the traditional safe haven as central banks print into oblivion. It's defensive & reactionary.\n\nBitcoin's performance is **offensive monetary warfare.** Every pump is adoption. Every dip gets bought by institutions who understand that digital scarcity trumps physical scarcity in an increasingly digital world. If we zoom out from the YTD to the one year chart you will see what I mean.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*14UjXlbC4Uv9fJVIy1UcMA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*H9BnciVNTJyB06zz4yt1Vw.png)\n\n**What Gold Bugs Fundamentally Can't Grok**\n\nThe psychological block is real and it's terminal. Gold bugs suffer from three cognitive disabilities:\n\n**Tactile Dependency Syndrome**: They need to physically touch their store of value. This is literally caveman brain programming, which if I'm being honest I've fallen victim to myself. They can't conceptually grasp that mathematical scarcity is superior to physical scarcity because you can't drop math or lose math in a boating accident. Well I guess you can if your private keys are on paper, but that's why you should memorize or back them up in multiple secure places as well. Unless of course you meant to lose the coins in a boating accident.\n\n**Tech Illiteracy**: Most gold bugs think the internet is still a fad. Asking them to understand cryptographic hash functions is like asking a fish to understand aviation. They're neurologically incapable of processing why \"digital\" can be more real and permanent than \"physical.\"\n\n**Sunk Cost Commitment**: People like Peter Schiff have built entire careers and identities around gold supremacy. Admitting Bitcoin is superior would require psychological reconstruction that their egos literally cannot survive. They'd rather go down with the ship than admit they bet on the wrong horse.\n\n**The Fiat Aesthetic Decay**\n\nHere's the thing about dollar bills, they're actually lowkey beautiful in their original conception. The craftsmanship, the engravings, the symbolic imagery, there's genuine artistic merit there. But here's where it gets sinister: **they keep slowly changing the wording to be worse and worse.**\n\nCheck this progression:\n\n- Original notes: \"Will pay to the bearer on demand\"\n\n- Gold standard era: \"Redeemable in gold\"\n\n- Silver certificates: \"Redeemable in silver\"\n\n- Modern Fed notes: \"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private\"\n\nSee what happened? They went from promising to give you real money (gold/silver) to just... declaring their paper IS money by government decree. The aesthetic decline mirrors the monetary debasement, each redesign removes more substance while adding more bureaucratic doublespeak.\n\nThe Fed buildings? Pure architectural gaslighting. Neoclassical facades trying to project legitimacy and permanence while housing the most destructive monetary experiment in human history. It's like putting lipstick on a money printer.\n\nGold coins are genuinely beautiful, the craftsmanship is undeniable. But here's the thing: that beauty is static, institutional, top-down designed by committees and mints. Compare that to the organic beauty emerging from Bitcoin culture. The spontaneous development of orange-pilling, HODL culture, and laser eyes happened because Bitcoin inspires genuine grassroots aesthetic appreciation that spreads virally.\n\nWhen's the last time you saw organic cultural movements emerge around fiat currency? Actually wait, there was one: the \"End the Fed\" movement. And what were they advocating for? Getting RID of fiat currency. Even the only authentic cultural energy around government money was dedicated to destroying it. Meanwhile Bitcoin creates art, memes, and cultural movements that celebrate and strengthen the network effect.\n\n**The Scarcity Singularity**\n\nGold: \"We only mine 2% more per year!\"\nBitcoin: \"21 million. Forever. Mathematically guaranteed.\"\n\nThis isn't even a competition. Gold's scarcity is contingent on geology and mining economics. Asteroid mining could flood Earth with more gold than exists in all human history. Bitcoin's scarcity is enforced by cryptographic consensus, literally unchangeable without breaking the laws of mathematics.\n\nGold bugs cling to thousands of years of precedent, not understanding that we're living through the greatest monetary evolution in human history. They're like people in 1995 insisting that physical mail will always be superior to email because \"you can touch letters.\" Which is a shame and I hope more gold bugs wake up because they are right about so many things, but being a luddite in this case will not serve them well. At the least they should get off zero BTC. Let the record show I have a gold necklace I wear all the time so I own some gold myself. I'm not a nogolder!\n\n**The Commodity Classification Reality Check**\n\nBoth Bitcoin and gold are commodities, but they operate in fundamentally different paradigms:\n\nGold is a **physical commodity with proven utility,** industrial applications in electronics, medical devices, aerospace, plus millennia of monetary history. It's actively used, actively traded, and serves real functions beyond just sitting in vaults. Gold markets are sophisticated, liquid, and global. It's not \"passive\", it's battle-tested across civilizations and unfortunately probably high manipulated as well by Central Banks.\n\nBitcoin is a **digital commodity with emerging utility,** it's simultaneously a monetary network, a settlement layer, a programmable asset, and a technological platform. The key difference isn't activity vs passivity, it's **evolution vs establishment.**\n\nHere's the real distinction: Gold's utility is **mature and proven** but also **constrained by physics.** You can't teleport gold, you can't program gold, you can't verify gold authenticity instantly from anywhere in the world. Its use cases are well-defined but fundamentally limited by the laws of matter. This leads to third parties, like Central Bankers, butting in and manipulating the markets quite easily.\n\nBitcoin's utility is **expanding and programmable** because it exists in the digital realm where the only constraints are mathematical rather than physical. Every protocol upgrade, every Lightning channel, every new application built on top adds utility that didn't exist before.\n\nGold is playing the game it's always played, just really, really well. Bitcoin is inventing entirely new games.\n\n**Government Spending and the Control Problem**\n\nThe gold standard failed because governments could still manipulate the system, they just fixed prices artificially and printed more paper than they had gold to back. Classic fiat move with extra steps.\n\nBitcoin standard is **ungovernable by design.** No central authority can print more Bitcoin. No government can set Bitcoin prices. No bank can rehypothecate Bitcoin beyond what actually exists (without getting rekt by people who can audit the blockchain).\n\nGold bugs pine for a return to the gold standard, not realizing that Bitcoin IS the new gold standard, except this one actually works and can't be subverted by corrupt institutions.\n\n**The Final Orange Pill**\n\nDigital gold isn't just an analogy, it's an **upgrade.** Bitcoin takes everything good about gold (scarcity, durability, desirability) and fixes everything bad about it (portability, divisibility, verifiability, seizure resistance).\n\nThe aesthetic argument alone should be enough to orange-pill anyone with functioning pattern recognition. Beauty in mathematics, elegance in code, perfection in monetary policy, this is what happens when Austrian economics meets computer science and creates something more beautiful than either discipline could achieve alone.\n\nGold bugs can keep fondling their rocks while the rest of us are building the future of money. I hope they also fondle a node and some private keys, but it's hard to teach an old dogs new tricks. I'd much rather see my sound money brothern win out over the fiat parasites. Yet, people who refuse to adopt will be forced to learn from pain. Their loss is our opportunity to stack more sats before more people wake up and eventually stop trading the monopoly money for the perfect one.\n\n> _mfw gold bugs still think you need to physically touch money for it to be real\n mfw Bitcoin's mathematical beauty is incomprehensible to boomer brain\n mfw we're still early_\n\n**The transformation is inevitable. The orange pilling will continue.**\n\n7/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
