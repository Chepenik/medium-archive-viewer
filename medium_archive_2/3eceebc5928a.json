  "content": "# Day 1277\n\nI've been going ham on an article for liquidity tonight and I don't want to share it here as I already shared the draft a couple of days ago. I'm tired though from rewriting and reworking the same essay over and over again.\n\n![GOOD](https://miro.medium.com/1*6-dCzvMVAAcFnWTpWP8PyQ.png)\n\nGreatness requires sacrifice. Want something done right? Do it yourself, over and over again until you get it right. Simple as.\n\nI will share seven insights from the essay with some humor added in because unless you enjoy studying monetary theory like I do these ideas can be a bit dry. So hope you get some alpha from this anon and you don't have to read 1.5k words either to get the idea:\n\n- **Politicians are addicted to debt like college kids to ramen.** The fiat system structurally requires ever-expanding credit; \"fiscal responsibility\" is political suicide.\n\n- **Fiat money is a Ponzi scheme with better branding.** New money comes in as credit, but the interest isn't created - meaning the system must keep inflating just to stand still.\n\n- **Liquidity is the invisible tide, and Bitcoin surfs it best.** When central banks flood markets with money, Bitcoin rockets; when they drain it, Bitcoin wipes out - but it always gets back on the board.\n\n- **Responsible government is Bitcoin's kryptonite.** If politicians suddenly balanced budgets and lived within their means, Bitcoin would be in trouble - but that's about as likely as Congress skipping a pay raise.\n\n- **The Fed is juggling grenades with oven mitts.** Price stability, jobs, and keeping the Treasury market alive can't all coexist - so they keep printing and hoping the music doesn't stop.\n\n- **Bitcoin flips the script: twelve words > twelve guns.** Instead of violence and coercion backing money, Bitcoin uses encryption and scarcity, letting anyone carry wealth across borders in their head.\n\n- **The trade is simple: unlimited fiat claims vs. 21 million Bitcoin.** Politicians will always choose the printing press over pain, and as long as that Ponzi keeps running, being long Bitcoin is one of the most logical bets on Earth.\n\n9/19/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
