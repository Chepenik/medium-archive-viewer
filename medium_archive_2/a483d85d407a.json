  "content": "Day 1383\n\nWent into the city today to hang with my buddies. Amazing day so far even though I've just been chilling at my wife's sister's apartment watching Ryder while Paige and Sloan went out.\n\nBut now me and Keenan are ubering back to his place & then going into the city once I drop my backpack off. A comedy club and Pubkey await us, safe to say I'm excited :)\n\nGrateful for time with friends and that Keenan got to meet my son. An excellent Saturday so far that I'm sure will only get better!\n\n1/3/26\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
