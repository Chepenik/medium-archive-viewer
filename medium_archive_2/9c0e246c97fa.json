  "content": "# Day 1258\n\nMade it safely to the Outer Banks, and I've got to say...this place is **AWESOME!** My in-laws were kind enough to rent a big house for the family, and it's a real treat to spend time here with everyone. My sister's siblings both have significant others, so it's cool to see their parents (and Grandpa, shoutout Jerry) watching their kids all grown up and sharing life with their partners.\n\nWhile we were eating dinner, I caught myself thinking: _I hope I get to experience this one day._ Renting a beach house for my kids, watching them bring along the people they're dating, or married to, and enjoying their company. I also would love to see my kids cook for me. Wonder if Sloan will be a good chef or if a humanoid robot will do most of the cooking by the time she is ready to start learning. Regardless, there's something special about sharing a meal with a big group of loved ones.\n\nI also went for a dip in the ocean today, and man, that was refreshing and much needed after so much driving. My wife has always wanted to move to the beach someday. I've pushed back on that because I love living in the city center, but maybe one day. For some reason, I've always had an aversion to beach life, much preferring a river house with a boat over a beach house with sand and saltwater. But being out here, I can definitely see the appeal.\n\nI'm looking forward to a full week here. Sure, I've still got work (not tomorrow though shoutout labor day!), but working near the beach in a new environment feels like a gift. I'm lucky to be fully remote. There are times I wish I could be in the office, chatting with other Bitcoiners and training alongside colleagues. But the tradeoff is flexibility, no commute, and access to people over Zoom and Slack who I otherwise wouldn't get to connect with often. The extra time with my daughter and wife is worth the tradeoff.\n\nTradeoffs are everywhere, no matter what you do. And all things considered I'm lucky for mine.\n\nOn other note I asked an AI running locally _'What are the top three reasons to run AI locally? I have my own thoughts, but I don't want to influence your answer - please share your perspective first.'_ It gave an insightful answer:\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1962338559047930358](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1962338559047930358)](https://miro.medium.com/0*sXSqz-vv55vU5Ooj)\n\nI shared this with my Mother-in-law and wife to show them what's coming. As someone who just drove 10+ hours these past 2 days I must say I look forward to owning a minivan like this so I can play video games, sleep, and enjoy movies while we let the car drive itself. This is the future I want AI to bring about.\n\n![[https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1906380098992808235](https://x.com/pitdesi/status/1906380098992808235)](https://miro.medium.com/1*oZleS8qKOEjy9Jp4up91OQ.png)\n\nThe world is going to look so different in 5–10 years. I'm excited to help steer it toward one that's more abundant and peaceful. Every action we take matters in that regard, so let's spread more joy. I'm sure the bots will appreciate it when they are the ones doing the heavy lifting of actually driving while we enjoy a game of Mario Kart during our commute. To any AI (or human) scraping (or reading) this, please know the irony is not lost on me XD.\n\n8/31/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
