If you don't believe my check out 7 trends my [moonshot mates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsFx5YErVEo&t=1585s) taught me today:\n\n**1. Everyone Becomes a Media Mogul**\n\nForget fighting over the remote, now the AI creates the whole show! Companies are releasing models like Sora 2 and Suno 5 that generate hyper-realistic videos and studio-quality theme songs that are incredibly easy to make and often totally free, meaning everyone can be a high-end content creator. Soon, you could have a personal Hans Zimmer making music for you for just eight bucks a month, giving you the perfect Bond-like soundtrack for your Monday morning commute.\n\n**2. The Great Interface Disappearance**\n\nSay goodbye to complicated menus, frustrating icons, and that dreaded cursor wobble because the natural language interface is taking over everything. Soon, everything from using your laptop to even designing and building a highway will be done just by speaking it into existence, fulfilling the dream of shouting commands straight out of a _Star Trek_ episode. This transition represents a godlike shift from mind to materialization, meaning complex technology will finally be as simple as... well, hopefully, simpler than your microwave oven.\n\n**3. Just-In-Time Software Materialization**\n\nHold onto your hats, coders, because AI models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 can now generate functional apps and user interfaces in real-time, right as you click a button, essentially cutting out the traditional software development process. We are entering a surreal world where every single pixel might be generated on demand, and your personal entourage of agents will constantly spin up customized capabilities for you that they anticipate you might need.\n\n**4. Abundance in Knowledge Work**\n\nThe world's top knowledge professions - including law, finance, consulting, and accounting - are getting completely rewritten as AI benchmarks (like GDP val and Apex) show models nearing superhuman capability, operating up to 100 times faster and cheaper than human experts. This is fantastic news because the AI can finally automate the nonsensical complexity we created (like the massive IRS code) and free up all that human talent to work on things that actually benefit humanity.\n\n**5. Solving All Math (And Everything Else)**\n\nGet ready for a \"Cambrian explosion of breakthroughs,\" because AI is on a hyper-exponential path to solving nearly all advanced mathematical problems, which provides the ultimate scaffolding for new scientific discoveries. When math is solved, related domains like physics, engineering, and medicine are expected to follow in rapid succession, resulting in a world drowning under a flood of scientific solutions.\n\n**6. The Longevity Leap**\n\nTop scientists are aggressively working to add decades or even double the human lifespan, with epigenetic reprogramming trials starting in humans and companies like Retro Biosciences entering human trials with pills designed to restart the brain's cleansing processes. The consensus from frontier AI models suggests that humanity will hit \"longevity escape velocity\" - meaning you gain more time than you lose to aging - around the year 2030, so hang on and try not to die from something stupid in the interim.\n\n**7. Solar Energy Defies Gravity (And Experts)**\n\nDespite what energy experts keep linearly predicting (spoiler: they've been wrong for decades), global solar capacity growth is vertical, making it the highest-capacity energy source worldwide at nearly 3 terawatts. Moreover, the physical component cost of solar modules has plummeted from the supposed floor of $1 a watt to almost a penny a watt, ensuring that we will soon have the terawatts needed to power humanity and the exponentially demanding new AI data centers.\n\nYea needless to say, I am still bullish and not just because of an orange shark. Although that is a great omen :)\n\nAlso I made this song today with 2 prompts:\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1974669321747169338](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1974669321747169338)](https://miro.medium.com/1*-cwa851ReOXpO-kqEgUCvA.png)\n\n10/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
