  "content": "# Day 1353\n\nGrace, have some damn grace in your life! GET BEHIND ME, SATAN! God poured out His grace on me when I least deserved it. As Ephesians 2:8–9 reminds us, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" He essentially says, \"You might be a sinner, but I've forgiven all sins through the blood of My Son. All you need to do is accept Jesus Christ as Lord.\" Incredible, truly incredible. What a life-changing realization. In the mess of daily living full stress, failures, & conflicts, grace means we don't earn our way: we receive it freely. Which is hard. How many times do we want to \"return the favor\". Yet we simply can not in this case.\n\nI'm writing this to remind myself (and maybe you anon ❤) to extend that same grace in your life to people. Forgive others, even those who trespass against us, as the Lord's Prayer teaches. And don't forget grace for yourself. When a bad day hits, smile, breathe, and move on. Hebrews 4:16 encourages us: \"Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.\" Life throws curveballs which include job losses, arguments, self-doubt, etc. But grace invites us to seek help boldly, not wallow.\n\nToday, I hit the gym for squats and bench press. Man, I needed that release. I joked with my buddies it was a total meathead workout, but hey, I snuck in shoulder raises, calf work, and a sauna session so not just chest and legs. It felt like grace in motion, pushing through the burn.\n\nIt reminded me of a gem I heard on a podcast: \"Depression can't hit a moving target.\" BANGER ALERT! Seriously, what a line. And \"GET BEHIND ME, SATAN\" hit hard too, especially after reading about grace. Evil thrives when we dwell on negatives, soaking in toxic thoughts. But grace empowers us to resist. In life, this means getting physical, or as The Blacked Eyed Peas said, [rock that body!](https://youtu.be/ywfq2ne7rKE) Whether it's a walk in the park, dancing in your kitchen, or hitting the weights, movement keeps the darkness at bay. Science backs it, but more importantly, it's biblical wisdom in action: 2 Corinthians 12:9 says, \"But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'\" When we're weak, grace strengthens us to move, turning vulnerability into victory.\n\nSo, in the grind of life, lean on grace. Forgive freely, seek mercy, and keep moving your body and soul. Don't stop growing or let Satan whisper lies; shout back with action. Grace isn't passive; it's the fuel for a vibrant, resilient life. My 2 sats :)\n\n12/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
