Yet, today, these principles collide with a challenge unseen by the Founding Fathers: the overwhelming and deliberate saturation of the public sphere by synthetic, non-human entities. The rise of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the realization of the \"Dead Internet Theory\" (DIT) compel us to re-examine one of the core assumptions underpinning the First Amendment, which is that the speech being protected is authentically human.\n\nThe wisdom of the Founders, notably Benjamin Franklin, remains profoundly relevant in the context of censorship. Franklin argued vigorously against giving the government the authority to regulate critical speech by criminalizing \"lies\" about the state. He realized that such power would allow the government to simply label any critique as a lie, thereby stopping it entirely. Franklin's counterpoint to figures like Alexander Hamilton, who believed the state should be able to regulate speech that falsely criticized the government, ensured that the constitutional framework protected satirical, critical, and unpopular dissent. This principle, that the cure for bad speech is more speech, has long anchored American discourse, fostering a culture where insulting or offensive speech is generally accepted and protected, unlike in countries like the UK, where arrests for social media posts are common.\n\nHowever, this framework was designed to manage conflicting _human_ ideas, not synthetic influence at scale. This is the heart of the \"Dead Internet Theory\" (DIT), which posits that the internet is increasingly dominated by robotic content, propaganda, counterpropaganda, or \"astroturfed\" operations, where one individual runs dozens or hundreds of fake accounts. This theory suggests that the online environment is becoming less a public square for human conversation and more a stage where moneyed interests, governments, and foreign adversaries play out influence operations.\n\nIf you have used chatGPT at any point these past few years then it is clear this theory is rapidly moving toward reality, assuming it's not already the case. Observations of contentious online debates reveal comments dominated by obvious bots (e.g., accounts with zero profile pictures, generic usernames followed by numbers, and hardline, inflammatory stances). Estimates suggest that on major platforms like Twitter, the percentage of bot accounts may be as high as 80%. Furthermore, the technological capability to produce complex synthetic content is skyrocketing, fueled by massive financial investment in AI research and synthetic thought systems. Given this proliferation, it is reasonable to conclude that AI will increasingly dominate the volume of written content online, making it difficult to discern human authenticity.\n\n**The Argument for Authenticity Verification**\n\nIn this new environment, the core argument for verification is that the First Amendment was established to safeguard the free expression of _the American people_. If 80% of online arguments are driven by automated interests, the speech of authentic human users is effectively being drowned out, manipulated, or warped by sheer volume.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of public information and ensure the First Amendment protects actual citizens, a _steel-manned_ solution suggests requiring proof of humanity as a prerequisite for First Amendment protection online.\n\n1. Protecting Human Discourse: By establishing a mechanism for people to prove they are not a bot, society ensures that resources dedicated to protecting free speech are primarily focused on human voices. This verification does not need to compromise anonymity; an individual should still be allowed to be completely anonymous online, but they should have to prove, in some verifiable way, that they are not an AI or bot network.\n\n2. Combating Propaganda: The most powerful weapons used by foreign adversaries like China and Russia are not bombs or missiles, but their ability to control people's minds through media and propaganda. The pervasive influence of bot networks makes it easier to trick citizens into believing narratives that are entirely divorced from reality. Verifying human identity (even without revealing that identity) counters the systemic deceit inherent in astroturfing and large-scale propaganda efforts.\n\n3. Restoring Trust: The informed populace relies on independent media and authentic information to hold power accountable. When all content is suspect, this critical feedback loop breaks down. A verified status acts as a signal of authenticity, even if the content itself is disagreeable.\n\n**The Steel Man Against Verification**\n\nThe counter-argument, rooted in traditional First Amendment philosophy, staunchly defends absolute anonymity and cautions against any process that links legal protection to identity verification, regardless of the stated intentions.\n\n1. The Threat of State Control: Any form of mandatory verification, even a \"proof of humanity\" test, introduces a mechanism of control. This harkens back to the danger Franklin warned against: granting the government (or the entities tasked with verification) the power to limit who can speak effectively. Historically, the government has continuously intervened in media and emerging communication platforms. Creating a system that dictates which online actors qualify for First Amendment protection risks establishing a framework for governmental overreach.\n\n2. Chilling Effect and Privacy Erosion: Requiring any form of authentication, even if promised to be anonymous, introduces privacy concerns. Many users, especially those criticizing oppressive regimes or powerful corporations, rely on total anonymity for protection. Imposing barriers, even simple ones, risks creating a chilling effect, discouraging individuals from expressing dissent.\n\n3. The Tyranny of the Majority: American tradition dictates that unpopular or offensive speech must be protected, irrespective of whether the majority approves. Introducing verification might subtly pressure people to conform, especially if the verification process requires interaction with platforms that are known for prioritizing certain social aims or ejecting employees who dissent from political correctness.\n\nIn conclusion, I am interested to see how this shakes out. Maybe a solution would be require sats (smallest unit of a bitcoin) to post on social media. [Stacker News](https://stacker.news/r/Chep) does this which is great. It imposes a cost on the post so bot networks are not as easy to spin up, but still wealthy enough bad actors could get around this.\n\nIt's not an easy thing to fix. I love the First Amendment and it is a great defense against the state's ability to silence human thought. Yet, there is no denying that in an age of pervasive AI, the threat could be reversed so the human voice is being silenced by the sheer volume of synthetic noise. Franklin was undeniably right that we should never grant the state the power to determine truth and falsehood. But if the vast digital commons is functionally dead, overwhelmed by computational power dedicated to manipulation, then the protection of authentic human speech becomes a matter of triage.\n\nThe challenge lies in devising a solution, such as a non-identifying, proof-of-humanity verification that preserves the sacrosanct right to anonymity while ensuring the First Amendment remains a safeguard for the sovereign human speaker, not merely an unlimited license for sophisticated machines to spread engineered narratives. Maybe some form of zero knowledge proofs solve this?\n\n10/16/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
