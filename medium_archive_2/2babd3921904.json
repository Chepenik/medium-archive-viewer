  "content": "# Day 1386\n\nToday marks my final day in the Tri-State area. We've been here since early December, and reflecting on the past month, I feel incredibly lucky. It's been such a blessing to have the flexibility to work remotely, allowing us to spend quality time with my in-laws, reconnect with old friends, and soak up the energy of New York City.\n\nI finally understand why they say the city never sleeps; it is chaotic, wild, and exhilarating. But after just three nights out this whole time up here, I've realized I'm happy to be a visitor rather than a resident. The pace is as exhausting as it is fun.\n\nAs much as I've enjoyed the adventure, I'm ready for the quiet comforts of home. I'm dreaming of my own bed and the freedom to step outside without bracing against the freezing cold. Being cooped up has made me realize how much I miss my daily routine and space. Also, how awesome it is to live in the sunshine state. It's been a wonderful chapter, but I'm ready to turn the page and head home. Until we meet again NYC🫡\n\n![POV: You are flying home from Newark airport.](https://miro.medium.com/1*pJGcWiRnTcHB_noVhfpIpA.png)\n\n1/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
