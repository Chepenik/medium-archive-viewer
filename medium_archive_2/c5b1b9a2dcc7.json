  "content": "# Day 1164\n\nTruth & Love. One of life's fundamental paradoxes is that a meaningful existence is spent pursuing Truth, yet we can never fully grasp it with absolute certainty. We can only strive toward it.\n\nWe absolutely should. This pursuit leads to fulfillment, happiness, and ultimately makes us better people.\n\nI once believed every human act was fundamentally selfish. Even seemingly good deeds, giving to others, acts of kindness, struck me as self-serving because they made us feel good. Conversely, selfish behaviors like taking from others served the same purpose: making ourselves feel better. Every action seemed to circle back to personal satisfaction. It was just a matter of if the act was good or bad.\n\nAt least I thought, but it seems to me that giving up your son to die for the sins of the everyone else, of the thing you created, well that is not a selfish act. **God** did that.\n\nFor me having children shattered this worldview. I discovered that truly unselfish acts do exist. I would do anything for my children not because it benefits me, but because something deeper compels me. I've come to believe that family serves as a microcosm of the divine. Just as we love our flawed children unconditionally, God loves humanity despite our collective imperfections.\n\nThis realization is profoundly beautiful. It gives me hope that we might teach AI to seek Truth with the same dedication, even knowing it may never fully achieve perfect understanding. The pursuit itself has transformative power; for humans and perhaps for the artificial minds we create.\n\n5/29/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
