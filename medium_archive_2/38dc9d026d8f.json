  "content": "# Day 1167\n\n**\"The path to wealth is through capability.\" - Michael Saylor**\n\n![[https://youtu.be/reVebuAf_Cs](https://youtu.be/reVebuAf_Cs)](https://miro.medium.com/1*0fb7MdAL-aXIam9iaFmRBw.png)\n\nInstead of chasing wealth directly, build capability.\nInstead of trying to scheme your way to riches, train yourself.\nBecome antifragile. Capable. Useful. Dangerous in a good way.\n\nThat's the kind of wealth nobody can inflate or seize.\nLiterally. Not when your savings live in 12 words instead of a bank account.\n_Not when your capital is Bitcoin._\n\nCapability isn't just having skills.\nIt's about knowing what to do when the system fails, because one day it probably will.\nIt's clarity under pressure. It's self-reliance when trust evaporates.\nIt's knowing how to hold your own keys, and hold your own line.\n\nIn 2025, capability looks radically different than it did even five years ago.\nYou now have access to a hundred supergeniuses, on-demand, by opening a browser and querying the mind of your favorite LLM.\nThe AI isn't just a tool. It's a forge.\n\nBitcoin, too, is a forge.\nIt sharpens your thinking. Forces time preference downward.\nTeaches you to see through noise.\nAnd rewards those who build instead of beg.\n\nI don't know what capability will look like five years from now.\nBut I know it will be forged by two tools: **AI and Bitcoin.**\nOne helps you think faster.\nThe other helps you store value that can't be seized, censored, or debased.\nOne is mental leverage. The other is monetary sovereignty.\nTogether, they let you do more with less, and save more in something real.\n\nBuild with one. Save with the other.\nThat's the new capability.\nThe new elite are not going to be the ones born into power.\nThey will be the ones who ask better questions, faster, and _own_ the results.\n\n**This is The Saylor Strategy (Execution):**\n\n- Ask the AI before you ask the lawyer.\n\n- Solve the problem before you pass it to your team.\n\n- Buy Bitcoin before you raise capital.\n\n- Build leverage before you need it.\n\n- Tell the story before they write it for you.\n\n**The Saylor Doctrine (Communication):**\n\n- Explain your strategy before anyone asks.\n\n- Communicate your mission before they doubt your motives.\n\n- Define your intent before someone else does it for you.\n\n- State your mission before they question your methods.\n\n- Name your principles before they're tested.\n\nCapability means execution.\nIt means precision.\nIt means speed and the freedom to act without permission.\n\nThe world doesn't need more opinions.\nIt needs more people who can get shit done _without asking_.\nSo don't wait for the degree, the title, the grant, the nod.\n\nTrain your mind. Sharpen your tools. Stack your sats.\n**Hold your keys. Build your fortress.**\n\nBecause the path to wealth, the durable, sovereign kind, goes straight through capability.\n\nAnd every other path?\n\nIt probably leads right back to fiat.\n\n6/1/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
