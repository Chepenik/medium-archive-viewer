To realize that pedophiles have immense power on this planet and likely won't face the consequences, here on earth, that they should for their vile actions.\n\nIt is grievous to acknowledge that many of those who commit unthinkable acts against children occupy positions of great influence and authority. These people manipulate systems, silence victims, and wield worldly power to protect themselves. And from a human perspective, it can feel as if they will **never be held accountable**. But Scripture assures us otherwise:\n\n> _**\"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\"**\n -_ 2 Corinthians 5:10\n\nThough justice may be delayed on this earth, it is never denied in heaven. These individuals will face a Judge whose eyes see in perfect truth and whose justice is not influenced by wealth, politics, or fear.\n\nTo those who have suffered and to those who mourn over this evil: **you are not alone**, and your cry has reached the throne of God.\n\n> _**\"He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?... he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?\"**\n -_ Psalm 94:9–10\n\nGod is not mocked. No hidden sin remains hidden forever. Every vile act, every deceitful cover-up, every abuse of the innocent will come to light, if not now, then in eternity. There will be **hell to pay**, quite literally, for those who do not repent.\n\n> _**\"The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.\"**\n -_ Psalm 9:16\n\nFor now, we groan under the weight of a fallen world, but we do not despair. Our hope is anchored in the One who said:\n\n> _**\"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\"**\n -_ Romans 12:19\n\nGod does not lie and this is a **promise from The Almighty**. Every tear shed by the innocent is remembered. Every cry of anguish is heard. And every act of evil will be judged with holy fire.\n\nSo take heart. The wicked may sit on thrones for a time, but **God reigns forever**. And in His court, there are no bribes, no false verdicts, and no escape.\n\n> _**\"For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.\"**\n -_ Psalm 37:28\n\nLet this be a word of strength to the grieving, a warning to the unrepentant, and a reminder to the faithful: **God will not be mocked. Justice is coming.**\n\n7/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
