  "content": "# Day 1384\n\nI had an amazing night in the city last night. Caught Billy Gardell, a.k.a Mike from _Mike & Molly,_ doing standup at the Comedy Village where we went. The man has shed serious weight and his set matched the transformation: tight, honest, and genuinely funny. The best bits were on parenting and marriage and his take that couples who never argue aren't healthy resonated with me. As he once said, \"You can be right, or you can be married\". Comedy that offers sharp observations dressed as jokes is fantastic in my book. Other comics performed but none were as good as Gardell in my opinion.\n\nI did stay out way too late drinking so this morning was rough, but I slept in. Once I got up, I walked to the Hoboken terminal and took the train back to Boonton. Forgot how much I like trains. The movement, the window, the not-driving. Maybe I'm slightly autistic, who knows, it would explain the Bitcoin thing.\n\nAnyways, as I rode on that giant metal tube today I kept circling back to this idea of building a side income through an online following, and today something clicked into place. Comics. Single-panel editorial cartoons. One image carrying a thousand words of commentary. I love comedy, I love density of meaning, and there's something about the constraint of one frame, with no escape routes that appeals to how I think. So let's see what I can do!\n\n![A picture of the NYC skyline from Jersey City](https://miro.medium.com/1*2RowNu8GO45uYciPRvPCWw.png)\n\n![Comic #1](https://miro.medium.com/1*x1LWsX_UGWJqPy7sRfcHqA.png)\n\n1/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
