Scripture condemned usury for millennia. Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus all flagged interest-bearing loans as exploitative mechanisms that enslave debtors to creditors. The biblical position was unambiguous: lending at interest corrodes social fabric and concentrates power.\n\nModern finance normalized what ancient civilizations recognized as predatory. Consumer debt isn't innovation, it's rebranded bondage, with better marketing. The system didn't break from biblical warnings; it monetized ignoring them. Whether you attribute this to deliberate corruption or emergent systemic evil is irrelevant. The outcome is identical: debt became the water we swim in, invisible to most until they are drowning in it.\n\nBut here's the inversion: in a fiat system designed around perpetual currency debasement, debt transforms from pure vice to strategic tool depending on what you finance. The moral framework remains, usury is extractive, but the tactical reality shifted. When central banks guarantee inflation, abstaining from debt while holding cash is financial self-immolation.\n\nDebt is a sorting mechanism. The poor borrow to maintain the illusion of middle-class participation, financing depreciating garbage that evaporates while the interest compounds against them. A financed couch. A vacation on credit. The new iPhone at 29.99% APR. Well actually the iPhone might be one of the few goods poor people can finance at 0% as carriers provide buy now pay later packages so people upgrade, the kicker being you better pay on time to avoid crazy fees. In the end, all this debt (including BNPL) means people are renting their own decline, paying premium rates to watch their net worth crater in real-time.\n\nThe wealthy borrow to acquire cash-flowing assets and inflation hedges. They understand debt as leverage against a monetary system designed to debase. In a fiat endgame, long-duration, low-interest debt becomes an asymmetric warfare against currency devaluation. Which is messed up in the sense that the debtor who buys assets wins against the creditor who lent money that is guranteed to be paid back in the same money which buys a lot less. Thus, those who understand this are highly incentivized to borrow worthless future dollars, buy scarce present assets, and let inflation destroy your liability while your collateral appreciates.\n\nZero debt sounds virtuous, and it is. It's a sad reality that we live in an inflationary regime. But you must play the game as it is. When central banks print 40% of all dollars in two years, holding cash is trash. Taking on debt at 3–4% while assets inflate at 8–15% is a pretty sweet deal.\n\nBitcoin. Tesla. Nvidia. Energy infrastructure. The asset class is irrelevant. What matters: you understand the thesis completely, the asset is scarce or produces cash flow, and it outpaces monetary expansion. If you can't explain why your asset survives the next ten years of monetary chaos, you're gambling.\n\nThe consumption trap is lethal. Finance a boat, you get temporary dopamine and permanent payments. Finance Bitcoin or dividend equities, you get compounding optionality. One leaves you poorer with a payment plan. The other leaves you wealthier while someone else's money does the work.\n\nGuns and butter, the economic trade-off between defense spending and civilian goods. If you're taking on debt, make sure you're buying the guns: the assets that defend and grow your position. Butter is delicious. It's also gone by morning, and the bill remains.\n\nThe system isn't broken. It's functioning exactly as designed, to separate those who understand the rules from those who don't. The biblical warnings still hold. The difference: now you must choose between righteous poverty and strategic adaptation. Debt is the accelerant. Your choice, should you choose to take it on, determines whether it incinerates your future or propels it.\n\n9/29/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
