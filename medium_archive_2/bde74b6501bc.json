  "content": "# Day 1254\n\nPeople ask what ideology I follow, like it's some abstract badge I'm supposed to wear. Truth is, I believe in whatever keeps me and my family alive and thriving. Capitalism, communism, monarchy, anarchy, it doesn't matter if the system is trying to put me in the ground. When survival's on the line, the only \"-ism\" that counts is **Survivalism**.\n\nWe all wear different masks throughout our day. Need to spend more time asking who are we without the mask. That's for ourselves, not somebody else, to figure out.\n\n![Glad to see that Cracker Barrel went back to the old logo](https://miro.medium.com/1*H-E0mXN9GVWQ8aKG3jRclw.jpeg)\n\nFind the lindy. Embrace it. Save yourself the effort, until it's time to suffer through something you love deep down.\n\n8/27/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
