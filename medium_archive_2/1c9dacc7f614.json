  "content": "# Day 1345\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1993784619112476908?s=20](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1993784619112476908?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*_33w0mnxyTkgf66U3lKQ9A.png)\n\nPeople love to say \"the tools change, but humans stay the same.\" It's a great line. I've used it myself. But if we're being brutally honest for a moment... no, we don't stay the same.\n\nFive years ago I was humming into a crusty phone mic, praying the Binmucker Podcast didn't sound like it was recorded in a shoebox. Today I type a half-baked idea into Suno and thirty seconds later I'm holding a fully produced track that actually slaps. Same kid who loved messing with audio, completely different superpowers.\n\nI was never a music producer. I just tinkered with podcasts. But what I can make now? It blows my mind.\n\nThat's the shift everyone underestimated: music creation jumped from years of practice and thousands in gear... to \"here's a vibe, make it fire.\" And the wild part? The better the prompt, the better the song. Prompting isn't some rocket science either. If you are bad at it, you can get better by meta-prompting, a.k.a asking one AI to improve your prompt for another. The machines aren't just helpful. They're recursively boosting your creativity.\n\nSuno blew up with millions of users in months. Half the internet is suddenly dropping tracks like it's SoundCloud 2012, and the other half is having a meltdown.\n\nOne camp yells: \"This is incredible! Anyone can make art now!\"\nThe other camp yells: \"This is the end of real music! More AI slop!\"\n\nBoth sides are loud. Both sides are half-right. And both sides are reacting to the same underlying shock: the timeline to create anything just collapsed.\n\nI can feel it with 3D printers and AI too. Give it five years and you'll say, \"Jarvis, design me a carbon-fiber longboard with RGB and a built-in speaker,\" and it'll do the CAD, the slicing, send it to the printer in your garage, and text you when it's finished cooling.\n\nThe tools can level us up if we actually use them with intention.\nThey erase gatekeepers.\nThey compress decades of effort into minutes.\nThey hand out god-mode cheat codes to anyone willing to type a sentence.\nAnd yes, I keep \"god\" lowercase on purpose. I don't believe these machines can give us a soul, only God can do that, but they absolutely make you feel like you've unlocked abilities you never imagined you'd have in this lifetime.\n\nSome people cheer the creative explosion.\nSome people panic because the sacred got automated.\n\nMe? I'm just sitting here grinning like an idiot, because the same kid who used to scream into a PlayStation headset during Call of Duty lobbies is about to 3D-print a custom guitar while an AI writes the riff and teaches me how to play it. I'd give it about 2 years before that becomes the reality. Who knows though, humans are bad at understanding the exponential function.\n\nSo to confirm, humans did not stay the same when we got new tools.\nWe leveled up. And the growing pains do not mean we should stop progress.\n\nThey mean we should be more thoughtful about how we use these tools.\nIf we do, we can create great art, great architecture, and great goods and services that inspire, lift people up, and create more abundance and prosperity for everyone.\n\nThat's the future I'm going to work on building.\n\nBang bang!\n\n11/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
