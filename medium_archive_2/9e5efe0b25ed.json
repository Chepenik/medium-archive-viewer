  "content": "# Day 1368\n\nGreat Friday so far. Got lunch at a nice place in a park in Hoboken, and hit the golf sim afterwards. Was a great time hanging with friends.\n\nNow to take a walk down to the path and meet my buddy, Bhomas Taker, in the big apple. Grateful for the chance to see old college friends.\n\nYesterday was also quite electric. I gave out tons of 3D printed Bitcoins and hit some dive bars in the city. That said, I'm very much looking forward to getting back to my family and not sleeping on a couch. Worth roughing it two nights to reconnect with good friends.\n\n![AI Makes Cool Photos](https://miro.medium.com/1*KzmkbKgyxYa9LYis1A_H7A.png)\n\n12/19/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
