Especially good ones. Grateful I got the oppurtunity to sit down with my daughter and watch this tonight. I need to be movie maxing. Especially movies I have not seen in a long time.\n\nThe movie industry will change with AI. But I hope enough people still see the value in feature length films and don't give them up because they want to scroll Tiktok, shorts, or reels.\n\nThat's why I'm going to build my theater when I have the capital to fund it myself. It's going to be glorious.\n\nWe are GOING TO MAKE MOVIES GREAT TO WATCH IN A THEATER AGAIN. Before I fund a communual movie theater maybe I should fund one in my own home so I can see what works best. Don't get me wrong movies on a TV are great too, but there is something so special about watching the film from a dope theater with a large popcorn and coke.\n\n10/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
