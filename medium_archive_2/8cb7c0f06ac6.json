The core issue isn't complex market dynamics but a brutal, simple reality: governments are structurally incapable of fiscal discipline, making continuous monetary expansion a near-certainty. This creates a predictable environment where holding Bitcoin emerges as profoundly logical, even as we endure short-term volatility from Federal Reserve speeches that move trillions in capital.\n\n**First Principles: You Can't Taper a Ponzi (Especially One Run by Politicians)**\n\nPoliticians won't rein in spending for one fundamental reason: electoral survival. In democratic systems, leaders must secure votes, which means avoiding unpopular decisions like cutting constituent benefits. This creates a perpetual cycle of spending money governments don't have, a tool they're unwilling to surrender to stay in power.\n\nThe result is a fiat monetary system backed by decree and coercion. Faced with massive deficits and mandatory spending on Social Security, Medicare, and defense, fiscal responsibility options vanish. The only viable solution becomes inflation: legal counterfeiting that debases currency to make old debts easier to service.\n\nThis isn't policy failure. It is the playbook of congress and central bankers working in cahoots to fleece the taxpayer.\n\n![_U.S. Federal Deficit Growth 2000–2025 with projection lines_](https://miro.medium.com/1*0x50ArYn_v0IEeT7dH_XwA.png)\n\n**Bitcoin's Greatest Ally: Irresponsible Government**\n\nHere lies a delicious irony: Bitcoin, created as an alternative to government-controlled money, thrives in environments of maximum government money creation. Its greatest existential threat would be the sudden emergence of responsible governments that balance budgets, pay down debt, and live within their means.\n\nFortunately for Bitcoin holders, this probability approximates Bitcoin's chance of reaching zero over the next twenty years.\n\nBitcoin has developed a passionate, predictable relationship with global liquidity, i.e the amount of money circulating through the world's financial system. Research shows Bitcoin moves in the same direction as global money supply 83–84% of the time over 12-month periods, with some analysts believing liquidity explains up to 90% of Bitcoin's price movements.\n\n_[CHART PLACEHOLDER (for now): Bitcoin Price vs. Global M2 Money Supply (21 Major Central Banks) - 10 Year View]_\n\nConsider the predictable reactions:\n\n- **COVID Response (2020)**: When central banks flooded the world with money, Bitcoin surged from $10,000 to over $60,000\n\n- **Tightening Cycle (2022)**: As they attempted liquidity withdrawal, Bitcoin crashed\n\n- **Recent Expansion**: As global M2 supply reached a record $55.48 trillion, Bitcoin price targets rose to $170K\n\nIn a world where fiat currencies face systematic debasement, an asset that captures and reflects these trends becomes invaluable. Bitcoin serves as both a hedge against debasement and a thermometer measuring the system's health.\n\n**Navigating the Fed's Impossible Position**\n\nWhile long-term monetary expansion seems locked in, short-term markets remain dominated by central banker pronouncements. Markets hang on Federal Reserve decisions regarding interest rates and quantitative easing, as these directly manipulate capital's cost and availability.\n\nJerome Powell faces an impossible stagflation trap: an economy with rising prices and a softening job market. He confronts a lose-lose choice: lower rates to help employment while risking higher inflation, or maintain high rates to fight inflation while risking employment collapse.\n\nDouble mandates mean serving two masters. Powell has indicated greater comfort with unemployment than runaway inflation because the Fed has \"tools to deal with that\" namely, flooding markets with capital, as done before. This reveals the underlying bias: when crisis hits, the default response is always printing more money.\n\n_[CHART PLACEHOLDER: Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion 2008–2025 with QE periods highlighted]_\n\nThis dynamic ensures that while we endure short-term volatility from one man's speeches, the underlying liquidity creation engine keeps running. This benefits Bitcoin tremendously long-term.\n\n**The Logical Conclusion: Long Bitcoin**\n\nFirst-principles thinking reveals a clear path. Political incentives ensure continued fiscal irresponsibility. This irresponsibility necessitates constant money supply expansion to manage debt, effectively debasing currency. In such systems, assets sensitive to global liquidity yet insulated from direct government manipulation are positioned to benefit immensely.\n\nBitcoin represents the purest expression of this thesis, a direct beneficiary of the very system it was designed to oppose. While the journey involves navigating central banker \"shenanigans,\" the destination seems clear.\n\nBut Bitcoin isn't merely a trade. It's a long-term savings vehicle. Most markets view Bitcoin as a risk-on asset. That's the real alpha: realizing most people don't understand that twelve memorized words allow you to transport wealth anywhere globally, where violence is demonetized, where people trade freely without middlemen (beyond the binary code running Bitcoin's protocol).\n\nEncryption is an incredible freedom tool. With it comes massive number appreciation as politicians, central bankers, and powerful interests demand more money printing.\n\n**They will not taper this Ponzi.**\n\nAs long as politicians prefer printing money to balancing budgets, being long Bitcoin remains one of the most logical positions available. As M2 grows and central banks shift toward easier policy, Bitcoin continues outperforming traditional assets, with macro-savvy investors recognizing this familiar pattern.\n\nThe math is simple: infinite monetary expansion meets finite Bitcoin supply. The outcome, while volatile in the short term, appears inevitable over longer time horizons.\n\n_The views expressed are the author's opinion and do not constitute financial advice. Bitcoin investments carry significant risk and volatility. The main advice to take away from this essay: study Bitcoin._\n\n![Art Deco Bitcoin Babe](https://miro.medium.com/1*l498S9rw6oZVIU3teQfWsw.png)\n\n9/15/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
