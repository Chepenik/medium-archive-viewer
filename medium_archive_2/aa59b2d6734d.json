  "content": "# Day 1348\n\nImproved an app I built awhile ago and bought a domain for it called [soundmoneymortgage.com](https://soundmoneymortgage.com/)\n\nIt's amazing what we can do with AI now. Makes me wonder what the future will look like in 5 years.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1994821585161916932?s=20](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1994821585161916932?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*fKWTwCDOck0y4j6XnCAsMw.png)\n\nJobs as we know them will change. I'm excited about the idea that there will be even more abundance. People will be happier. I know we can use these tools to improve humanity. That's how I'm going to use them. To better the world.\n\nBang bang!\n\n11/29/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
