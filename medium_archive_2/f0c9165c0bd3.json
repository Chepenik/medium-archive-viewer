  "content": "# Day 1313\n\nAlmost out of the hospital. I've been lucky enough to come and go, but I know Paige is more than ready to head home. Surprisingly, we even had a nice steak dinner here, not exactly what most hospitals are known for. Enjoyed eating a ribeye with my wife and newborn son.\n\nOverall, I just feel extremely grateful. Sloan met Ryder today, and it was hilarious. At first, she gave him a look like, _\"Who is this little s_** stealing all the attention from me?\" Thankfully, one of my co-workers had told me to get a gift for Sloan and say it was from Ryder. She loved it and kept saying, \"Ryder got me this!\" Before long, she started warming up to him. She gently touched his face, and right as she did, he stretched his leg and kicked her. She burst out laughing and started telling everyone Ryder kicked her. It was a beautiful moment with everyone smiling. Ryder got to meet his great Grandparents, his Aunt Jenna, both his Grandmas and tomorrow will get to meet his Grandpa. To no one's surprise everyone loved him.\n\nAnyways, I won't miss sleeping in the hospital, but overall it's been a really good experience. I'm especially glad we decided to hire a doula this time. I think it made a big difference for Paige. Will be awhile before we welcome our third child, Flynn, into this world but considering Paige has already manifested him I got to believe a third kid is in our future.\n\n10/25/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
