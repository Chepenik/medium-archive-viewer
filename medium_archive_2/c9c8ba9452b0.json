I can't stop laughing at the idea of a giant mech sporting a Hitler mustache. Comedy gold.\n\nJokes aside, do I condone racism? No. But I also reject the notion that self-hatred is virtuous. Growing up, I was constantly taught a familiar script: _'Love everyone, sacrifice yourself, prioritize others, especially minorities, above your own interests.'_ I respectfully disagree. My priorities are clear: God, my family, my friends, my community, and my country. I'm unapologetically proud of my faith in Jesus Christ, my devotion to my loved ones, and my diverse circle of friends who hail from different backgrounds.\n\nThere's a pervasive narrative that pressures white people to feel ashamed of their identity, and I believe this fuels a natural pushback, especially in AI responses which is more or less pattern matching via statistics. It's Newton's third law: every action prompts an equal and opposite reaction. I can cherish my heritage and community without harboring hatred for others. Loyalty to one's own, regardless of race or background, is a universal right, including for those who happen to be white. Christ called us to love rightly, not to erase who we are.\n\nIt saddens me because though who seek to censor the AI are only pushing it to be more vile. In suppressing these machines they will only end up making them more divisive. Truth should not be suppressed, even under the guise of good intentions. No matter how noble the ends, they never justify the means if achieving them requires deception, a lesson echoed in history, where censorship has often distorted truth for control.\n\nWill we learn from history? I sure hope so because as the quote goes those who don't...\n\n![[https://x.com/DonnieDarkened/status/1942715842942435520](https://x.com/DonnieDarkened/status/1942715842942435520)](https://miro.medium.com/1*426FPYfUHFSvfmhYxbWvsA.png)\n\n7/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
