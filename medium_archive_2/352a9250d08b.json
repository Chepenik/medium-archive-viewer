  "content": "# Day 1265\n\nI just spent a week in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Few things feel as blessed as waking up right on the beach, watching the sun rise over the Atlantic, breathing in salty air, and sipping coffee while the ocean stretches out forever. My in-laws made that possible, and I am grateful.\n\nThe days were full: morning runs through nature, rounds of mini-golf and real golf, hours at the beach. I did have some work, but remote life and Labor Day gave me margin to still spend time with family. Presence around loved ones is always a gift. Thank you for giving me the time to experience that My Lord.\n\nNow, as we drive home along I-95, I am reminded how vast America is. Towns, fields, stretches of rural land. So much potential, and proof of how much has already been achieved. Yet some towns look hollowed out, their main streets faded. It stings to see, but I still believe in the possibility of revival. I remain bullish on my fellow Americans despite what the propaganda networks we call \"the news\" want people to believe.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1964696219940511931](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1964696219940511931)](https://miro.medium.com/1*rO4JgB_a5eRqb-Yb-dIubw.png)\n\nOn the road, we stopped twice for coffee.\n\nThe first was in a small town not far from the Outer Banks. No visible menu. The iced coffee was brewed on the spot, poured over ice in a plastic cup. I grabbed a bacon, egg, and cheese that was surprisingly good. The shop was slow, the town clearly struggling, yet there was charm in the wait.\n\nThen we stopped at Starbucks. Within minutes, I had a venti salted caramel cream cold brew and egg bites in hand. The place gleamed with polish. Payment happened through the app, my Starbucks \"bucks,\" themselves a derivative of credit card fiat, which is itself a derivative of government money. Layers of abstraction, wrapped in convenience.\n\nWhich did I prefer? On a long road trip, efficiency wins. But my heart still roots for the mom-and-pop.\n\nThat contrast between slow charm and smooth scale made me think about AI.\n\nWe risk letting AI do to thought what monoculture agriculture did to food: trade variety, experimentation, and local difference for uniformity, efficiency, and volume. It is not all bad. Supermarkets and global supply chains made food cheaper and more accessible. AI will do the same for information. But the tradeoff is very real: the flattening of the spirit.\n\nLife is full of conveniences I wouldn't give up. If robots can someday wipe your butt, that's fine, though I'd prefer to do it myself for as long as I can and keep my own thoughts intact. Meditation, small rituals, conversations with strangers, I like to think that these keep us human.\n\nOne of the best moments of the trip was not the beach at all but a stop at a gift shop in South Carolina. My wife and I chatted with a kind Southern grandma about raising kids. Nothing groundbreaking, though her cereal-in-the-bottle advice to help babies sleep was memorable. What mattered was the interaction itself. It felt good, alive.\n\nThis is what I would miss in a world where everything is frictionless and outsourced.\n\nSo what will the next ten years look like? Will small towns recover? Will AI shape our lives the way industrial food reshaped agriculture?\n\nI do not know. But I know the tradeoffs will be real. And I know I want my kids to inherit a world worth inheriting, a world where the simple joys still matter, where conversations with strangers are valued, where our thoughts are not flattened into one acceptable narrative by soulless strings of 0s and 1s trained to keep people compliant.\n\nAI is a tool. Nothing more. Nothing less. It should sharpen our ideas, not replace them. If we use it well, it can expand what it means to be human instead of narrowing it. But that choice is ours.\n\nWe are free beings, gifted natural rights by a Creator. Let us not allow convenience to erode that gift. Easier said than done, of course. Ideas are cheap. Action is what counts.\n\nThe challenge of our time is not simply to think about the tradeoffs but to live them wisely. To choose when efficiency serves us and when slowness gives life meaning. To use tools like AI without letting them use us. To build a future where our children know both the thrill of innovation and the warmth of human connection.\n\nThat work begins in small ways. Brewing a cup of coffee. Talking with a stranger. Taking the long way home. Protecting the dignity of thought. These simple acts, repeated, become culture.\n\nAnd culture is what makes a nation.\n\nSo let us guard the spirit, not flatten it. Let us pass on to our children a world worth inheriting. One where convenience exists, but never at the cost of freedom, wonder, or truth.\n\n9/7/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
