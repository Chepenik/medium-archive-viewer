It's about how progress actually works. Most People Use AI Like a Vending Machine Insert prompt. Press button. Take whatever drops out. That's fine, if you're okay living on intellectual junk food. But if you want steak? If you want insight that hits harder and runs deeper?\n\nYou need to work the loop!\n\nThe real power is recursive. It lives in that feedback spiral between your raw thoughts and what AI helps you unlock. Not a one-off transaction. A dynamic system. One pass refines it. Second pass reveals blind spots. Third? It starts to sing.\n\n**What Actually Happens When You Go Recursive**\n\nHere's the thing most people miss: great prompters don't start with great prompts. They just refuse to stop at the first version. Recursive prompting lets you:\n\n- Catch your own vagueness\n\n- Discover angles you hadn't considered\n\n- Use each AI as a lens to see your idea from a new side\n\nThe magic isn't in the first iteration. It's in the compound effect. By round three, you're doing more than asking the LLM to craft a better prompts, you're becoming a better thinker. Recursive prompting trains your brain to think in higher fidelity.\n\n**Iteration Is the Mindset Most People Avoid**\n\nWhy don't more people do this? Because recursion means revisiting your own half-baked ideas. It means letting go of ego and embracing draft mode. It means saying: this might suck but it's a start. And that's hard. Most of us were taught that being right the first time was the whole point. That mistakes = failure. That iteration was a sign you didn't know what you were doing.\n\nNo wonder recursion feels unnatural. The hardest thing to unlearn...is the first thing you learned wrong. But recursion teaches the opposite: First drafts are meant to be crude. Feedback isn't judgment. It's fuel. Progress isn't linear. It loops. Every stumble, every reframe, it's just another pass through the function.\n\n**My 5-Layer Recursive Prompting Loop**\n\nThis is the system I try to use day in, day out, especially when I'm using an LLM. It's helped me go from decent to dangerous when it comes to coaxing great stuff out of models. I'm talking DANGEROUUUUUUUUUUS (Shout out Y.G)\n\n1. Brain Dump Messy, fast, unfiltered. Don't aim for perfection, just get the idea out of your head and onto the screen.\n\n2. Alternate AI Enhancement Feed that raw prompt to a different model. Ask: \"How can I make this more specific, elegant, or creative?\" Let the model sharpen your thinking.\n\n3. Human Edit Pass Review what the AI gives you. Keep the gold. Cut the fluff. This is where your judgment comes in. You should not be outsourcing thought here. You should be amplifying it with 0s and 1s.\n\n4. Final Execution Now run the refined prompt in your go-to model. Watch the output level up dramatically.\n\n5. Meta-Recursion (Optional but potent) Take the output you got, and ask: \"How could the prompt that generated this be improved?\" or \"Here is what I liked about this output and what I disliked, knowing that how can we keep improving this output\" Then prompt the computer again.\n\nYes, this sounds like overkill. No, it's not. Some of my best writing and clearest thinking has come after a bunch of recursive loops.\n\n**Why This Works: It Mirrors Real-World Mastery**\n\nRecursive prompting isn't a gimmick. It mirrors how pros improve in any field. Musicians drill tiny sections over and over. Writers revise line by line, word by word. Athletes film themselves to correct form mid-motion. The pros don't fear the loop. They live in it. And what recursion does is compress that loop. Instead of taking weeks to revise, you're tightening the cycle to minutes. You get the reps. You see the growth. You level up.\n\n**Life Is One Giant Recursive Function**\n\nOnce you see this pattern, it's hard to unsee.\n\nSay the wrong thing → Feel bad → Reflect → Say it better next time\n\nStart a side project → Realize it's clunky → Ship v2 → Iterate again\n\nParent poorly → Apologize → Improve the bond → Try again tomorrow\n\nNone of us level up on a straight line. Life loops. Over time, the loop teaches you to see your blind spots, to question your defaults, to sharpen how you show up.\n\n**Your Recursive Challenge**\n\nIf you've never tried recursive prompting, do this today:\n\n1. Pick one thing you do a lot - email, tweets, writing, even tough convos.\n\n2. Run it through the loop: Draft it Ask AI to improve it Edit it again Run it Review and revise\n\n3. Track what changes. The speed at which you get better? Wild. The confidence that comes from knowing you can improve anything? Transformational.\n\n**One Last Recursive Twist**\n\nYou're reading this essay right now. This essay is recursive. I drafted it. Then used AI to refine it. Then reworked that. Then ran it back. Even this sentence, meta as it is, was part of the loop with a final human in said loop to make sure this didn't read as AI slop.\n\nAnd that's the future: not AI replacing us, but humans who know how to collaborate with their own iterations. Humans who use recursion as a ladder to new heights.\n\n**Final Thought**\n\nYou don't need better tools. You need better loops. Recursive prompting will make you sharper, faster, and clearer. Not just with AI, but in every part of your life. The game isn't who gets it perfect the first time. It's who's willing to go through the loop the most. Who has the hyper focus to keep iterating until they get it right.\n\nVending machines give answers. Loops build thinkers. Choose your path.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*L5rTMhMVp3xprReD-YyGyg.png)\n\n6/14/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
