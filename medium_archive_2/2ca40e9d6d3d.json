  "content": "# Day 1195\n\nOne word I keep coming back to is grace. Which is actually one of my sister's name - shout-out Grace. But the word in question, grace, is such a great word because everyone on earth can use some grace. We all make mistakes, we are all fallen creatures.\n\nYet we also have so much potential. Made in the image of The Almighty.\n\nIs the Bible talking about our soul being made in his image? Or flesh & blood.\n\n**Genesis 1:26–27** (KJV):\n\n> _\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\"_\n\nI asked AI for further insight and was told\n\n> This \"image\" (**Hebrew: _tselem_** and _demuth_, meaning image and likeness) does not refer to our **physical flesh and blood**, because God is a Spirit (John 4:24) and does not have a human body.\n\n> Rather, being made in God's image primarily refers to our **spiritual, moral, and rational nature** - our soul. This includes:\n\n> **Moral Responsibility** - We have a sense of right and wrong (Romans 2:14–15).\n\n> **Spiritual Capacity** - We can know, worship, and have a relationship with God (Ecclesiastes 3:11; John 17:3).\n\n> **Rationality and Will** - We can reason, choose, and create (Isaiah 1:18).\n\n> **Dominion and Stewardship** - As seen in Genesis 1:28, man was given responsibility over creation.\n\n> So, **yes - the image of God is primarily about the soul**, though it affects the whole person. Our physical bodies are also dignified because they are part of God's creation, and ultimately, believers look forward to the **resurrection of the body** (1 Corinthians 15).\n\n> And indeed, though we are fallen (Romans 3:23), **grace through Jesus Christ** redeems us and restores that image progressively (Colossians 3:10; 2 Corinthians 3:18).\n\nIt's pretty cool someone made a [BibleGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/686205b6-4020-8009-9083-bd592073fb76). Man I love the internet. It's just a tool after all, but a damn powerful one. Use it wisely.\n\nGlory be to God.\n\n6/29/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
