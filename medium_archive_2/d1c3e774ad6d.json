  "content": "# Day 1214\n\n![Bitcoin > Fiat money](https://miro.medium.com/1*v1Amg9Z-OGQ5aFC0GNRKvA.png)\n\n**The Signal and the Noise**\n\nI'll tell you what I think about the way\n This world treats those who see clearly today:\n With blank stares, with noise, with suspicion's sting - \n They laugh at builders, bow to middleman kings.\n\nThe noble Bitcoin, forged in cryptographic gold,\n That rang so true throughout the world of old,\n Has shown us what real money ought to be\n While fiat currencies sink beneath the sea.\n\nBut something changed beneath the broken sky - \n Not from banks or kings, but code that cannot lie.\n The paper they worshiped turns to dust\n As inflation reveals their breach of trust.\n\nThe fiat they printed, worthless copper dressed\n In silver lies, has failed its hardest test.\n While shoppers' wallets bulge with paper dreams,\n The wise have turned to digital gold's gleams.\n\nBitcoin didn't ask for their permission,\n Didn't compromise its sacred mission.\n Block by block, it ticks with perfect time,\n Each hash a verse in freedom's truest rhyme.\n\nThe old coins, once honest, became the scam - \n Debased and worthless by decree's cruel hand.\n The soundest men withdrew from circulation\n As central banks destroyed each honest nation.\n\nBut now they're coming back, not to serve\n But build the future that we all deserve.\n They're mining hope and stacking precious time,\n Writing tomorrow in each block's paradigm.\n\nLook around, anon, the signal's clear and bright:\n This isn't darkness - this is dawn's first light.\n While empires crumble in their slow denial,\n Truth marches forward, block by block, with style.\n\n_**You can't kill an idea whose time chain has come.**_\n\n![The Signal & The Noise](https://miro.medium.com/1*VVKIwJzxynftW0iWjaaWUA.png)\n\nGod Bless.\n\n7/18/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
