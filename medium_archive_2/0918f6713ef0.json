  "content": "# Day 1344\n\n![I am blessed. Thank you Jesus❤](https://miro.medium.com/1*wiF-OzTgXOJv7dKbvRdpXA.png)\n\nEating dinner with my family outside in the backyard. Enjoying time spent in lounge chairs afterwards, laughing with the ones I love. Practicing gratitude for all my blessings.\n\nMan, is it easy to get discouraged looking on social media and seeing people flexing about various things. Yet, one must realize it's all show. Few people post their Ls, and if they do, it's often to show off the big W that came afterwards.\n\nSocial media has brainwashed us to think it's easy to get rich, to have six-pack abs, to get what you want immediately without immense sacrifice. Alas, Rome was not built in a day. The great things in life take sacrifice.\n\nI hope you know, Anon, this post is just as much for me as it might be for you. A reminder that nothing great is easy and that's how it's supposed to be.\n\nI often think, man, if I just won the lottery I would do so much cool stuff and build everything I wanted. Yet, to actualize something is quite hard, and if you don't grind through the challenges, then the reward at the end won't feel, well, as rewarding.\n\nSo next time you get down about whatever random bs, propaganda, timeline slop that appeared on your feed, remember real life is not digital life and that gratitude goes a long way. You will be much happier in life if you can do that.\n\nI might not know you personally, but I do love you because I love God & God is inside every one of us. Have an excellent day, you deserve it. Go out and spread the love he implanted inside your soul. Cheers Anon!\n\n![Stack Sats For Your Last Name, Not Your First](https://miro.medium.com/1*LdhSlSNK-M1Pioyn5ZLpSw.png)\n\n11/25/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
