I have no idea if quad-entry bookkeeping will ever exist, or what that would even look like, but I'm confident Bitcoin is the peaceful revolution of our lifetime.\n\nOne that will continue to demonetize violence and create lasting abundance.\n\n![Pepe enjoying his Bitcoin via a Lollipop](https://miro.medium.com/0*sD2aRWb30w6WKWJw)\n\nI'll finish tonight with a draft of an op-ed I want to share with bitcoinnews.com to help spread the good word of my Coloring Book:\n\n**Coloring Outside the Lines with Bitcoin**\n\nWhen my daughter asked me, \"Dada, will you color with me?\" I thought it was just a small favor. I sat down with crayons in hand, and what started as a quiet bonding moment quickly turned into something much bigger. Coloring felt cathartic. It slowed me down and gave me space to think. That's when the idea struck me: what if coloring could also be a way to teach kids about Bitcoin?\n\nThe next generation is being saddled with debt created by politicians and bureaucrats who think central banks are magic money printers. If my daughter and kids like her are going to grow up in that environment, why not give them a head start with sound money? That was the seed of _The Bitcoin Coloring Book_.\n\nI wrote it with 2–10 year olds in mind. Little ones can scribble all over it and still learn something from the shapes and images. Older kids can pick up the words and connect the dots about money, value, and responsibility. Parents can sit alongside their children, read to them, and use it as an excuse to talk about saving and creating. Honestly, it works on multiple levels.\n\n**Bitcoin, Crayons, and Responsibility**\n\nThe lesson I wanted to embed is simple: Bitcoin empowers people, but it also requires responsibility. It's a tool for freedom and low time preference thinking. It rewards saving and discipline. And it demands you protect your private keys. The book also carries another message that I hope kids and parents feel: you matter, your choices matter, and what you create matters. That's true whether you're a toddler with crayons, a teenager stacking sats from a summer job, or Jamie Dimon conjuring loans out of thin air and wishing Bitcoin would go away.\n\n**The Grind of Making a Book**\n\nPeople think a short book must be easy to publish. Let me tell you, the hardest part was editing. I must have read it a hundred times. It's the tiny details that trip you up, and by the fiftieth read you're cross-eyed. Thankfully I ordered a test copy before going live and caught some things that would have haunted me forever. That experience gave me a whole new respect for authors and editors. If you ever write a book, make sure you pick a subject you truly love, because you'll need that fuel to carry you through the repetition.\n\n**How People Use It**\n\nI imagined lots of crayon scribbles, and I was right, at least judging by the masterpiece on my own coffee table. But what I didn't expect was how meaningful it would feel to read this book to my daughter before bed. Watching her face light up when she sees Bitcoin on the pages is priceless. By the time she's old enough to hold her own keys, she will be ready to handle the responsibility that comes with them. That's the kind of early orange pill every parent can be proud of.\n\n**What's Next**\n\nThe Bitcoin Coloring Book isn't the end of the journey. It's a first step. Looking ahead, I want to keep using Bitcoin in my own life to improve it, keep deepening my knowledge, and eventually write a full-length book. That probably won't be a book solely about Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will be woven into it naturally because it's woven into how I see the world.\n\nFor now, my main focus is on family. My second child arrives this fall, and I can't wait to start reading the book to him as soon as he's able to grab a crayon. The response from the Bitcoin community has been humbling. When you put something out there that provides real value, people rally behind it. That has been the most rewarding part of this whole experience.\n\nAt the end of the day, this book is about more than coloring. It's about planting seeds. It's about helping kids, parents, and maybe even newcomers to Bitcoin understand that freedom comes with responsibility, and that the best way to prepare for the future is to build on something solid. For me, that's Bitcoin. And sometimes, all it takes to share that truth is a box of crayons.\n\n**Where to Get a Copy**\n\nBitcoin is a win-win game. The best way you can support me is by helping educate others about it, which is why this book is [free to print online](https://bitcoincoloring.com/). Open access, no paywalls, trust-based sharing. You don't have to pay a single satoshi to put it in your kids' hands.\n\nThat said, if you'd like to support me directly and prefer a professionally printed copy, you can pick one up on Amazon [here](https://amzn.to/4mY6Tja). I'm grateful for everyone who chooses that route, and even more grateful for every family that uses this book as a way to educate others about Bitcoin.\n\n8/24/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
