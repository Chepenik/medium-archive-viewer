Absolutely stunning.\n\nI always say I'm happy I don't live in NEW YORK CITY, but man is nyc so fun to visit. It's busy. Crowded. Kind of dirty. But it's also one of the coolest places to be.\n\nThe energy, the vibe, the fact you can do something 24/7/365 is quite special. Man it's a treat to visit.\n\nGrateful to have friends and family in the area. Also grateful to live in Florida.\n\nI do not take any of it for granted💯\n\n5/20/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
