  "content": "# Day 1312\n\nDeep gratitude: God answered my prayers. Ryder Jay Chepenik was born today and is happy, healthy, and doing amazing. My Dad told us Wednesday he had a dream that Ryder would be born Friday and sure enough his astral projection during his rem sleep was spot on. Respect Father.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1981844073293185284](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1981844073293185284)](https://miro.medium.com/1*zyGK_Roau9wkIKvom26kwA.png)\n\n![Feels good to be a boy Dad](https://miro.medium.com/1*kvnk41Bm4da5z5IxvX3KgA.png)\n\nCan't wait to play sports with my little man. Teach him about video games, computer science, and of course, Bitcoin. Man it's been awesome being a Dad and I'm so excited to welcome my 2nd child into this world. There is a bit of a learning curve since boys have, well you know, boy parts. I'm not going to lie, Ryder peed in his face today when I was trying to change his meconium poop for the second time. Sorry about that lil man. If you don't know what meconium poop is, consider yourself lucky.\n\nThe nurse let me know to hold his junk down whenever I change him so it doesn't spray up. Noted hahahaha.\n\nAnyways, it has been a long past few days. Proud of my wife. Grateful to God. Excited to watch Ryder grow up. Big day tomorrow as well because Ryder is going to meet more of his family, including his big sister Sloan.\n\n10/24/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
