At least I think so because that feels like my life lately. I see so much happening and progressing that I am both beyond excited and a bit overwhelmed. Chasing dopamine, but unsure how to act on it to build lasting dopamine rather than the cheap hits I get delivered from scrolling. Anyways, let's go with a new title since this was more like a stream of consciousness rant to start my 1317 Medium in a row.\n\n**The Crux Of The Issue: The Contemplative Human Versus the Accelerating Machine**\n\nEveryday I consume more information than what someone 200 years ago got in a day. Source? I made that up, but I suspect it's accurate. I have 24/7/365 podcasts if I want them. Now I do need to sleep, eat, and relieve myself, but if the desire is there to learn about something I can ask chat, Youtube, or any of the other amazing tools on the internet. But mental masturbation only gets you so far in life. One must do. Actually going out into the world and testing your ideas well provide a lot more signal than consuuuuuuming a podcast.\n\nBut then again, Bitcoin podcasts have put me in a much better position financially than I would be in otherwise. So let me be clear I'm not hating on podcasts. It's the reason I save in sound money and don't panic sell on dips. I have also now seen how freeing it is to have your whole day to do whatever you want. Being on pat leave has honestly been fantastic. I do love my job, and would like to keep working at Swan for a long time.\n\nThat said, man is it empowering being able to spend my days doing the things I like whenever I want. Ironically, I find myself waiting until the end of the day to do my Mediums but that's okay. There was a [tweet](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/1983228380028993640) I saw while searching for cheap dopamine that has stuck with me. 'Tis linked above and I do recommend reading it. The tl;dr what do you do once you have generational wealth. If Bitcoin does what I think it will do, well then in ~10 years I will have the means to retire, but I'm not sure if I will because I genuinely enjoy my work.\n\nDo brainstorm with me though anon. Imagine the summit. Power, control, wealth - all yours. The toys arrive: homes that span horizons, experiences scripted to perfection. The party peaks. Then fades. Now what? What do you do when money is no longer buying you happiness?\n\nIt is a deceptively simple probe into the human condition. Brian Roemmele's response from experience was a great answer, having witnessed the before and after of extreme fortune. Wealth does not resolve the insecurities it was meant to erase. One might argue it just amplifies the person you already were. Relationships warp under suspicion, love for the person, or the ledger they represent? The drive that propelled ascent becomes a hollow echo. Brain noted that one billionaire, hollowed out, envied the \"normal\" soul who could still desire. I'm honestly glad I have started to make my family now rather than once I have the financial means to buy just about any experience, or thing I desire.\n\nThis is not mere anecdote. It is archetype. The machine of ambition accelerates us to heights, then strands us in vertigo. The future, then, cannot be more acceleration, more gadgets, metrics, dopamine pings. It must offer descent into meaning.\n\nOld books often whisper this truth if we take the time to read them. Sadly they often get ignored in our TL;DR age. Ecclesiastes: \"I denied myself nothing my eyes desired... Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done... everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind.\" Solomon, wealthiest of his era, echoes Roemmele's billionaire. The Stoics counseled the same: virtue as the sole good, fortune indifferent. Epictetus, enslaved yet free: \"Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.\" These texts endure because they force slow digestion. No summary captures the rumination required.\n\nNow enter the accelerating machine: AI, the elite synthesizer. It devours libraries, spits insights in seconds. Chat models recite Epictetus flawlessly, yet miss the contemplative pause, the internal debate that births wisdom. I scroll, thrilled by progress: fusion prototypes flickering to life, robotics swarming warehouses, random racist memes which I wouldn't dare repeat in public but in private I chuckle, compute clusters blooming like digital forests. The internet has it all. Excitement surges. Overwhelm follows. Dopamine hits cheap and fleeting, like Dory's mantra twisted: just keep scrolling.\n\n![I think the actual quote was just keep swimming, but I digress.](https://miro.medium.com/0*IRTZWCIUde1_6uj0.jpg)\n\nBut lasting dopamine? That demands building. Not for self, but ladders.\n\nRoemmele points to the anonymous Bitcoin wealthy. Names unknown, egos unchecked. They walk among us, channeling fortune into soil enrichment. Not flashy philanthropy with press releases. Quiet acts: funding protections around nascent ideas, ensuring seeds survive winters of disruption. One seed, tended, yields fruit for great-grandchildren unseen.\n\nThis is the future's promise. Not universal basic income handouts, but universal basic opportunity, fertile ground where anyone plants. Automation displaces jobs; AI synthesizes knowledge at lightspeed. The contemplative human intervenes: What now? Build ladders from the summit down.\n\nQuestion this. Ladders sound noble, but history litters with false ascents of charity as ego polish, foundations masking extraction. It seems the real seeds grow from doers immersed in the world, among people, maximum good without fanfare. Anonymity guards purity. Bitcoin's rise democratized wealth creation for many, unmooring it from gatekeepers. Many early holders, grounded still, choose stewardship over splurge. I hope to follow in some of those footsteps even if I will never see the same gains as those who got in when 1 bitcoin was under 1 dollar.\n\nThat said, doubt lingers. Is anonymity scalable? One person's ladder, another's hidden influence. Yet the principle holds: post-achievement, the game expands. From player to groundskeeper.\n\nTying this back to mastery, the observer watches himself self play, fully in, fully aware. Wealth's \"win\" reveals the illusion of endpoints. True play: observe the larger board, act generatively. The machine accelerates creation; the human contemplates direction.\n\nFuture offers abundance reframed. Energy unbound with modular reactors, maybe even fusion, powering not just yachts, but global compute for open models. Robotics frees labor from drudgery, not to idleness, but creation. AI synthesizes the past; humans infuse purpose.\n\nI feel this tension daily. Progress cascades: orbital factories, gene therapies, neural interfaces. Overwhelm tempts retreat to scrolls. Contemplation pulls back: read old books slowly, question each line. Act, but observed.\n\nDead end: What if machines outpace contemplation entirely? Superintelligence decides \"now what\" for us. Revision: No. The anchor is human, recursive, self-doubting. AI mirrors, amplifies, but lacks the void that births meaning. We program the pause. We are the ones who the Alpha and Omega bestowed souls upon. We can't put a soul in silicone.\n\nProgression: Personal summit → civilizational summit. Humanity nears collective wealth, post-scarcity glimpses. Now what? Ladders at scale. Protect seeds: open-source breakthroughs, decentralized governance, education as soil.\n\nThe contemplative human slows the machine just enough to steer. Not Luddite halt, but mindful velocity. Old books remind: haste chases wind. Synthesis without reflection is noise.\n\nIn short: The future means transcending the self's game. Build ladders. Tend seeds. Observe the play, then expand the field. That is lasting dopamine, the quiet thrill of unseen fruit ripening. AI is a great tool, but it must be used with reverence for the ultimate AI, i.e YOURSELF.\n\nOur spirit can watch from above and enjoy the seeds we plant. Nihilism is mid. Let's strive to build a better future we won't see from our fleshy bodies. My 2 sats.\n\n10/29/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
