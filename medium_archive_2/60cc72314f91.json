My gosh if that is not one of the most [insightful things](https://youtu.be/i60yHFbwRbI) I have heard in a long time I am not sure what is. We got algoslop grabbing our attention constantly. Case in point, I started writing this then stopped to see who won the NYC election and now an hour later I'm back here writing this.\n\nSo how do you fix it? Well you look within of course. So obvious yet so easy to miss. That urge to look away is real. To open a new tab and distract yourself with some dopamine. I hope you know anon this post is really for myself more than anyone else. It's so hard to focus when you are distracted by everyone else's bullshi*. When you can't look away from the hot mess that is social media.\n\nCognitive security (_cog-sec)_ is going to be one of the most important disciplines of the digital age. The more time we spend online, the more armor we'll need for our minds. AI isn't going to make this easier; it'll make the dopamine drip faster, cleaner, more targeted. I've felt it myself, the stress from scrolling headlines about places that don't even affect my life. The NYC mayor race? Why do I care? I live in Florida. If anything, the chaos up north just drives more capital down here. My quality of life probably improves because of it.\n\nSo many opinions that ultimately don't impact me. Focus on finding joy in your life. Dopamine drip from algoslop will not bring it. If anything it will destroy the joy you have. Life is a blessing and we have free will because God is inside all of us. Embrace your divinity. Smile everyday. Do not lose sight of all your blessings.\n\n**Smile. Breathe. Be thankful.**\nReal life, not the synthetic digital counterfeit, is the real reward loop.\n\n11/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
