  "content": "# Day 1340\n\nI've lost more money on paper these past two months than I had to my name across all four years of college. To be fair, I had no money in college, but watching that number evaporate is kind of insane. I honestly don't feel much because I know the long term thesis is still intact. Anyway, I'm buying more the second I see my paycheck hits.\n\n![Recent Bitcoin Price Action](https://miro.medium.com/1*jH_pfdNJSzK1Y9F4Z6CEYQ.png)\n\n![McDs Bitcoiner](https://miro.medium.com/1*42MSks-a7It7xUmjEmLfnQ.jpeg)\n\n![Rocket Ship Bitcoiner](https://miro.medium.com/0*k5iZgkn_GzG0TqH9)\n\nI am also working on making chepenik.com a Bitcoiner website. When others are fearful it's time to be greedy and build. When in doubt zoom out!\n\nI know in 5 years we will be multiples above where we are now. That's the beauty of an asset with a finite supply.\n\nBitcoin has no top, because fiat has no bottom.\n\n11/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
