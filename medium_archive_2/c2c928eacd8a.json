  "content": "# Day 1379\n\nI've enjoyed a fair share of red wine during dinner while up here, and it's honestly impressive how much it slows you down. It's numbing, sure, but sometimes that's exactly the point. The constant background noise in your head gets turned down a few notches and suddenly doing nothing feels acceptable. I feel like I could sink into the couch and stay there without feeling guilty about it. It also makes it easier to speak a bit more freely, without overthinking every word on the way out.\n\nIn general, the \"benefits\" of alcohol don't really show up unless you're looking at it through a social or practical lens. There's plenty of data explaining why you shouldn't drink, and I agree with most of it. But tonight, a glass of wine made it easier to put my kids to sleep, and that makes it worth the tradeoffs in my book. When the little ones are exhausted and losing it, it's easy to get frustrated or short-tempered, especially at the end of a long day. After a glass of wine, I was noticeably more relaxed about the screaming and chaos. I gave Sloan a bath, got her into her jammies, scratched her back for a bit, and she was out cold before 7:15.\n\nMan, it's nice getting them down early. Now the WiFi is back, I've got no pending Bitcoin News articles to write, and a second glass of wine has been poured. I'm going to wrap this up and put on Rogue One. Life is good.\n\n![The Wifi is back](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZBH4dA1hhCHByJvJRY89WQ.png)\n\n12/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
