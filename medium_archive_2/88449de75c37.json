  "content": "# Day 1248\n\nOne downside of fasting hit me today and it's that I've been uncharacteristically grumpy. That is not how I want to show up for my family. It's worth noting for future fasts. The whole 'you're not you when you're hungry' saying is ringing painfully true right now.\n\nThis afternoon we took a family walk, and I found myself scolding my child when she started playing in the mud, and gleefully picking up sticks. My patience was paper-thin, and I was ready to shut down her joy. Thankfully, her mama stepped in with a gentle nudge: \"She's just a child exploring the world.\" Those words hit home. She was absolutely right. My daughter's curiosity, her spark of wonder, is what makes her shine. I can't let a fleeting mood dim that light.\n\nIt got me thinking about how easy it is to lose sight of what grounds us. Take Cracker Barrel's recent rebrand, a chain built on rustic charm and Southern roots, now stripped of its iconic barrel logo for a sleek, soulless design. They're chasing innovation, trying to appeal to a new crowd, but it feels like they're abandoning the heart of what made them special. Social media's erupting, and their stock's tanking, down over 12% these past 5 days, because loyal customers feel betrayed. It's a reminder that straying too far from your roots can cost you what matters most. Like Cracker Barrel, I was at risk of forgetting my core: being a present, patient dad.\n\n![[https://www.google.com/search?q=cracker+barrel+stock&oq=cracker+barrel+stock&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyFAgAEEUYORhGGIMBGPoBGLEDGIAEMg0IARAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgYIAhAAGAMyBggDEAAYAzINCAQQABiDARixAxiABDINCAUQABiDARixAxiABDIGCAYQABgDMgYIBxAAGAMyDQgIEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyBggJEC4YQNIBCDM1MzFqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=cracker+barrel+stock&oq=cracker+barrel+stock&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyFAgAEEUYORhGGIMBGPoBGLEDGIAEMg0IARAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgYIAhAAGAMyBggDEAAYAzINCAQQABiDARixAxiABDINCAUQABiDARixAxiABDIGCAYQABgDMgYIBxAAGAMyDQgIEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyBggJEC4YQNIBCDM1MzFqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)](https://miro.medium.com/1*w6Zbpm18Wo9xZtR-d6ppaA.png)\n\nHaving children is a gift. They see magic in the mundane, mud puddles become playgrounds, sticks turn into treasures. I won't let a fast, no matter how well-intentioned, steal those precious moments or dull my daughter's spark. I'm grateful to my spouse for unknowingly pulling me back and to my family for their patience with my hangry missteps. Sometimes, the best lessons come when we least expect them, reminding us to hold tight to what makes life great.\n\nPlus, it is a lot easier for me to course correct than it is for Cracker Barrel since I don't have a board or shareholders. That said, I hope Cracker Barrel scraps the redesign.\n\n![[https://x.com/amuse/status/1958256206138441811](https://x.com/amuse/status/1958256206138441811)](https://miro.medium.com/1*MpbxiLMyQlfkG0masEa9yw.png)\n\n![Hole in one](https://miro.medium.com/1*cm-5t8I4PjDynE4pOoS6yA.png)\n\n![Sunset Green](https://miro.medium.com/1*7KBSYgAoo7XWVp017lEoDg.png)\n\nI just added the Bitcoin photos because I like Bitcoin & Golf. Sometimes you just need to combine two of your passions. Find synergy in the things you love.\n\n8/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
