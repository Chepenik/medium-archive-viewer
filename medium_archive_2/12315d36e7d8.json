It's needed to feel good.](https://miro.medium.com/1*NYZyrfyBcZcg3dp2JfRAwg.jpeg)\n\n**Fiat Lies, Bitcoin Tells Truth.**\n\nYour dollars are counterfeit promises. Central bankers print value away while calling it \"policy\", legalized theft in a suit.\n\nMoney has a soul: store value, measure work. Fiat kills that soul. Bitcoin resurrects it.\n\nEvery printed dollar says your labor is worthless. Every satoshi says your time is sacred.\n\nChoose: trust human overlords or trust math. One steals by decree; the other protects by design.\n\nBitcoin: money that can't lie.\n\n### If you want a longer version of this see below\n\nPicture this: A magician walks on stage, waves his wand, and declares, \"Let there be value!\" The audience gasps as he pulls dollars from thin air. Impressive? Sure. Moral? That's where things get interesting.\n\nWelcome to modern monetary policy, where central bankers have convinced us they're financial wizards rather than elaborate pickpockets.\n\nBut you see, money has a Body and a Soul.\n\nHere's something your economics professor never told you: money, like everything real, has both form and matter. Think of it as having a body (paper, metal, code) and a soul (what it actually does i.e store value, facilitate exchange, measure worth).\n\nWhen central banks print money, they're not creating value. They're performing surgery on money's soul while leaving its body intact. The patient always dies. Your savings are the casualty.\n\nSimple economics really, just theft with a PhD.\n\n**The Gospel According to Gnosticism**\n\nThere's a dangerous religion spreading through financial institutions. Let's call it \"Monetary Gnosticism\" the belief that with enough secret knowledge, you can reshape reality to match your fantasies.\n\nThese modern Gnostics whisper: \"Trust us. We have the secret sauce. We can create prosperity from nothing.\"\n\nSound familiar? It should. Every con artist in history has used the same pitch.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: There's no such thing as morally neutral money.\n\nPlanting an economic system in unethical soil is like expecting roses from a garbage dump. You'll get something growing, all right. But you won't like the smell.\n\nDebased money creates debased societies. When productive work becomes disconnected from reward, civilizations don't just decline, they collapse into meaning crisis. People stop asking \"How can I create value?\" and start asking \"How can I game the system?\"\n\n**The Dignity Deficit**\n\nEvery time someone prints money they didn't earn, they're making a statement about you: Your labor can be diluted. Your time can be stolen. Your choices don't matter.\n\nIt's not a question of economic theory. This is a question about human dignity.\n\nYou have a rational mind capable of understanding truth. You have free will to act on that understanding. When monetary systems steal your productive energy through debasement, they're treating you like a resource to be mined, not a human to be respected.\n\nGiving any institution unlimited financial power guarantees abuse. Always. It's not pessimism, it's physics. Power concentrates. Corruption follows.\n\nThe solution isn't better people in charge. It's systems that don't require saints to function.\n\n**You're Not an Island (And That's Good News)**\n\nIndividual freedom doesn't mean going full hermit in the woods. Humans are social creatures. Your liberty and mine are connected like links in a chain. When one breaks, we all feel it.\n\nThe answer isn't isolation but instead, I believe, it's building systems that respect both individual dignity and collective flourishing.\n\n**So How Can I take Action?**\n\nIgnoring a broken system isn't neutral. It's participation.\n\nEvery time you accept the comfortable lie that \"this is just how things work,\" you're casting a vote for the status quo. Every time you pretend inflation is natural rather than engineered, you're enabling the engineering.\n\nResistance doesn't require violence. It requires truth-telling. It requires building alternatives. It requires saying \"no\" to monetary manipulation and \"yes\" to honest money.\n\n**To Conclude**\n\nThis brings us to Bitcoin, money that can't be debased, can't be printed, can't be manipulated by decree.\n\nIt's not perfect. Nothing human-made is. But it's something previous generations could only dream of: money that serves humans rather than ruling them.\n\nBitcoin that forces us to confront uncomfortable questions like \"What is value?\" \"Who creates it?\" \"How should it be measured?\" \"Who has the right to dilute it?\"\n\nI'm gonna go with no one, personally.\n\nThank you God for making Bitcoin. For making Satoshi. For making a way to introduce perfect digital scarcity into humanity so we could get away from the debt slavery of fiat money.\n\nI hope by now you realize these aren't just financial questions I'm posing. They're moral ones.\n\n**The Choice**\n\nHumanity has two options:\n\n1. Accept that monetary manipulation is inevitable, natural, and necessary\n\n2. Demand money that respects human dignity and productive effort\n\nLet us choose carefully because civilizations have risen and fallen on less.\n\n## If you want to listen to an even longer version of this, that inspired these writings see here: [https://youtu.be/bk2ol_Inqt0](https://youtu.be/bk2ol_Inqt0)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fbk2ol_Inqt0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dbk2ol_Inqt0&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fbk2ol_Inqt0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"[https://youtu.be/bk2ol_Inqt0](https://youtu.be/bk2ol_Inqt0)\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n7/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
