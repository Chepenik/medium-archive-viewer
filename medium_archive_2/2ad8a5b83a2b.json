  "content": "# Day 1165\n\nI'm on an Amtrak today, heading up to Boston from New York and I've got to say, traveling by train is surprisingly nice. It's spacious, peaceful, and there's no traffic stress. You can even grab a beer on board. Honestly, it's a quite a vibe.\n\nThis is my first time doing it for a long trip, and now I fully understand why my wife was furious when I bought a bus ticket for us down from Boston to New York. This is _so_ much better. Lesson learned. 😂\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Jh6KmUeT1Y_uj1klvT_cbg.png)\n\n5/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
