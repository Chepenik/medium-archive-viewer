  "content": "# Day 1315\n\nThere is more magic in the world than we want to believe.\nOr maybe it's better to say, more than most NPCs believe.\n\nIf you're reading this, you're probably not one of them ;p\nGlazing the reader aside, even NPCs can become playable. \nThey just have to lean into the magic.\nFunny how that works.\n\nA recent example: my father had a dream.\nHe told me, on Wednesday, that my son would be born on Friday.\nHe said it casually; like it was already written.\nSure enough, Friday came, and so did my son.\n\nNow, you can shrug that off as coincidence.\nYou can summon your inner Reddit fact-checker and call it confirmation bias.\nBut maybe, just maybe, the rational mind isn't the only receiver of truth.\n\nWhen my dad told me, the logical part of me dismissed it.\nI said, \"Nah, he'll be born tomorrow.\" (What would have been Thursday)\nBut the older part of me, the one that still prays, the one that feels instead of calculates knew better.\nWe mustn't be so quick to ignore divine intuition.\n\nThe Alpha and the Omega.\nThe King of Kings.\nThe Creator of everything.\nYou really think He can't whisper something like that into a Grandfather's dream?\n\n[Even the Soviet Union, the most materialist regime in history, \nfunded parapsychology research for decades.\nThey tried to measure telepathy, psychokinesis, and remote viewing.\nThe CIA did too.](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000600350001-3.pdf)\nGovernments, scientists, spooks, all poking at the same mystery: \nthat human consciousness might reach further than flesh and bone.\n\nMagic, God, intuition, coincidence,\nthese are often different names for the same shimmer underneath reality.\n\nSo yeah, maybe there is more magic in the world than we want to believe.\nMaybe the NPC inside each of us just needs to remember how to play again.\n\nAnd beware of who you choose to love,\nbecause love is the oldest magic of all.\n\nIt's what God had when he said FIAT LUX!\n\n![Let There Be Light!](https://miro.medium.com/1*EsIrN33f0itjolzc2Jy-eg.png)\n\n10/27/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
