  "content": "# Day 1289\n\nI must say getting outside and socializing is so nice. It makes me think I need to sign my kid up for sports.\n\n![I am the golden tee champion](https://miro.medium.com/1*fYA2WIro3-prllKYAqI_Qg.png)\n\n![Trivia champions](https://miro.medium.com/1*5P3EwbSNIuUglZNtCayoHA.png)\n\nIt's good to get outside. On the one hand I am grateful for my work from home job, but humans were meant to socialize. So when I get the chance it's a real treat to get outside and socialize with my buddies.\n\n10/1/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
