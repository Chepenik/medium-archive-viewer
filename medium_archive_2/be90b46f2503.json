The real bottleneck right now is human nature.\"\n\nMost conversations about AI start in the same place. GPUs, power grids, data centers, memory architecture. Those things matter, sure, but they are not what is actually slowing this down in the real world. What is slowing it down is fear, incentives, and the quiet self interest of people who just discovered a private productivity miracle and do not want to give it up.\n\nPicture a normal corporate job. FP&A. Accounting. Operations. Monthly close. The same cycle, every month. Pull the data, reconcile the numbers, build the model, generate the deck... For decades, a full week of every month has disappeared into spreadsheets and cleanup work.\n\nNow imagine you quietly build an AI agent. It pulls the data, cleans it up, reconciles everything, and builds the report. What used to take you 25 hours now takes 25 minutes.\n\nDo you tell anyone? If your boss finds out, do you get promoted, or does he just take the system and give you more work? On paper the rational answer is yes. You should tell your boss. You should tell your team. You should let the company benefit.\n\nIn reality, I suspect many don't. Because the moment you admit it, you give up your leverage. Your job becomes a line of code. Your value collapses into a script. You do not get rewarded for saving the company time. You get punished by becoming easier to replace.\n\nSo my would wager would be on a lot of people just staying quiet. They take the win privately. They work 25 hours instead of 45 and let everyone think nothing has changed.\n\nMultiply that across millions of white collar jobs and you start to see what is really happening. Enormous productivity already exists, but it is hidden. It lives inside personal workflows, private prompts, and small automations that nobody wants to hand over.\n\nI see it in my own work. AI has made me dramatically better at what I do for Bitcoinnews.com because it lets me spend more time on the actual interview and less time fighting the page or cleaning up drafts after the fact. The leverage is real, and if I were sitting inside some massive Fortune 500 company, I have no doubt I would feel that same pull to protect it, to keep my edge quiet and enjoy the extra breathing room. In my case I am lucky. The Bitcoinnews guys treat me well, I am not buried in a giant corporate org chart, and I can be open about how much this has changed my workflow. Most people are not in that position, which is why this gets so interesting so fast.\n\nThat instinct to protect your edge is not some character flaw. It is just human nature, and it is exactly why human nature could be the real bottleneck. It also ties directly into Saylor's line about credit. The world might be built out of capital like factories, servers, data centers, real estate, and chips, but it actually runs on trust, on promises, on coordination, on the belief that when you show up tomorrow the other side will too.\n\nAI is more than a productivity story. It will change the balance of trust inside organizations. If one person can quietly do the work of five, the entire credit structure of a company starts to wobble. Managers think they are buying labor, but in reality they are buying access to a black box of prompts, scripts, and models they do not control.\n\nThat is why this transition feels slow and messy. The machines are ready to automate tedious tasks, but many people are protecting themselves. Ironically, that friction might even be a good thing. If every company adopted AI at full potential overnight, the layoffs would be brutal and the shock would be destabilizing. Instead, we are getting something closer to a slow leak. People quietly automating their own jobs. Startups moving faster than incumbents. Old institutions lagging while new ones are built natively on automation.\n\nI suspect the next ten years will feel insane, but it will not look like one giant AI explosion to those playing in the game. It will look more like a million small betrayals of the old way of working. Underneath it all is the same tension that has always existed in financial systems. Capital wants efficiency. Credit requires trust.\n\nAI pushes relentlessly toward efficiency. Human nature resists anything that threatens status, identity, or security. If someone figures out an incredible AI hack that lets them outcompete everyone else, of course they do not give it up. They keep it. They use it. They turn it into leverage. That is not a flaw in the system, it is how every wealth creating system has always worked.\n\nAI doesn't erase human incentives, it actually supercharges them, transforming quiet self-preservation into a force that reshapes economies and egos alike. If human nature truly stands as the ultimate bottleneck, then the next decade won't revolve around circuits and code, but around us: flawed, ambitious creatures fumbling to harness this newfound might without unraveling the fragile threads of trust, equity, and purpose that hold society together. I, for one, am I excited to play the game these next ten years.\n\n1/12/26\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
