  "content": "# Day 1331\n\nI need to start writing earlier in the day. Last night I meant to get up and write, but I quickly realized after tucking in my child that I myself wanted to go to sleep. Thus, I went ahead and passed out.\n\nIt felt great and I legit got about ten hours of sleep. I'm a night owl by nature but I do see the reason why some people would prefer to go to sleep early and wake up before the sun is up.\n\nEnough about my sleep schedule though. What did I do today? Well these two tweets summarize it well:\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1988749760765755520?s=20](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1988749760765755520?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ztEwyIDbEPeIuOb04HGg8Q.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1988765414239736178?s=20](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1988765414239736178?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*K7ET_lhMtW6cJXxOQzClJQ.png)\n\nExcited to find a field and try out this toy once I have all the parts I need. I do imagine metal screws would make it last longer, but for now will rock with the 3D printed ones. So cool how quickly one can prototype.\n\nAnyway, the time has come for me to tuck in my 2 year old so I'm going to go ahead and do so. I do plan to get up and do other stuff tonight, but it's hard to get up after laying in a dark room for 30 minutes...\n\n11/12/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
