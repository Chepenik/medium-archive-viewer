  "content": "# Day 1366\n\nMan I got a feeling that 2026 is about to be wild. I'm not sure why exactly, but it's a feeling that I am indeed feeling. I guess AI, disclosure (a new movie coming out about alien disclosure which makes me think hollywood is prepping people), and mid term elections!\n\n![[https://x.com/martyrmade/status/2001467896170738130?s=20](https://x.com/martyrmade/status/2001467896170738130?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*FBi5ZFe1Zw3mQE6ptNTMXg.png)\n\n![A Powerful Prayer](https://miro.medium.com/0*30Ti4Hi2e69kfz6F)\n\nLord please give me the strength to be a great Father. To give my children what they need to be good people in this, rapidly (dare I say exponentially) changing world. Thank you for the blessings you have given me. I am forever grateful.\n\nNo matter what happens my Faith is with Him. I know it will all be okay in the end. \"So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand\" **Isaiah 41:10**\n\nGlory be to God.\n\n12/17/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
