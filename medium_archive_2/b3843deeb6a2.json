  "content": "# Day 1369\n\nBack in Boonton after two nights out in the big apple - feelsGoodMan.gif. Grateful for good friends and nights out in NYC, but man...coming home and holding my two children close by was so refreshing. One of those surreal moments that makes you step back and go how blessed am I.\n\n![Bom & The Binmucker](https://miro.medium.com/1*TZocOfAqoG1YC4uJSywhEw.png)\n\nAfter grabbing an Uber back this morning, I showered and we headed over to Paige's friend Emme's aunt's house. Beautiful place. Sloan had a blast playing with Maddox, Emme's nephew, who's right around her age. Now I'm back in a big, comfy home, ready to sleep in a real bed instead of a couch, and I'll actually be in before 2AM.\n\nLife is good :)\n\n12/20/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
