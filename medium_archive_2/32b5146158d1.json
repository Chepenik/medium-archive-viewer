  "content": "# Day 1385\n\nMight need a digital detox if I ever want to write a book. You know, a real book, one that is long and where the Author (me) holds a single idea for more than eleven seconds. But X has me trapped in the hustle porn loop: build this bro, this guy literally dropped a masterclass, unhinged meme that makes me laugh harder than it should. It's like a pug. So neurologically broken it circles back to irresistible. Maybe that's just the internet now. Engineered brain damage we consent to daily.\n\nI know AI is moving fast. I know this is supposedly prime building season. I know sitting still feels like falling behind. But velocity without direction is just expensive confusion. Sometimes the most productive thing is to stop producing. To think in paragraphs instead of tweets. To remember what it felt like to be bored long enough for an actual idea to surface.\n\nHard when the brightest minds of a generation are paid handsomely to keep your thumb moving.\n\n![It's time to lock in (Click buttons correctly on my computer)](https://miro.medium.com/1*13nl6RVmtFPN_XECkwbuIQ.png)\n\n1/5/26\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
