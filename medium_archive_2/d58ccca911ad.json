  "content": "# Day 1260\n\n![[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)](https://miro.medium.com/1*nRTgS-kmOuHIJUudJE_eGg.png)\n\nWe are so vain to think we can outsmart most of these traders. The market is brutal and does not care about you. It wants to take your money and leave you destitute. To make it so your bloodline is impoverished and unable to afford food.\n\nThe sooner you learn this the better off you will be. You know who beats the market? The market makers. The insiders. Our congressmen & women with insider information. Wall street firms with algorithms I will never understand. I wish it weren't so. But my wishes mean nothing to the crony capitalists willing to privatize all their gains and socialize the losses on the plebs (i.e the taxpayers).\n\nYou know why it's important to stay humble in regards to your finances? Well there is a lot of reasons, but the first one is that over 99% of us can't outperform the markets. I'm too lazy to google it right now, but I'm pretty sure that even most hedge funds don't outperform the S&P. So you think you can? Lol, Joe Schmo reading shi*tposts on X about the next hot stock is not going to outcompete Jane Street. If that offends you please understand I look back on my past self and know I too was a Joe Schmo.\n\nThe difference between me and my old self? I wisened up. I realized trading is futile. Get long hard assets. Short the thing they can print out of thin air. Then hodl. Do nothing else other than learn about proper ways to custody private keys. Practice multi-sig set ups. Elimante single points of failure. Harden your security and op-sec so bad actors will be killed, jailed, or severely injured if they try to harm you and your family. Find ways to increase your income so you can stack more sats. Take on smart leverage if you can access it. Meaning long duration leverage that doesn't post your most pristine asset (bitcoin) as the collateral. If you're not able to get access to that kind of leverage then just stack patiently.\n\nIt's that simple. But no...most of us don't want the simple solution. We want the get rich quick scheme. The easy path to wealth. The 10x we can brag about at the party to get the girl. Be careful out there anon. Any girl willing to sleep with you over a 10x on a memecoin likely wants to steal your wallet afterwards.\n\nThe reality is real wealth doesn't boast about its gains. Doesn't feel the need to validate itself amongst strangers. It moves in silence and when it sees an opportunity presented to make money it sure as hell does not tweet about it for the plebs.\n\nThis is the harsh reality of the markets. You can learn this the hard way. Or you can wisen up and Hodl.\n\nMy 2 sats.\n\n9/2/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
