  "content": "# Day 1354\n\nI saw a tweet today, a short reflection about ego & internal change, and after reading it thought wow, that is such a good point. Not because it was flashy or motivational, but because it pointed to something most people never admit: the hardest part of transformation isn't the work itself. It's letting go of the need to be seen doing it.\n\n![[https://x.com/BonesawMD/status/1996542731649216703?s=20](https://x.com/BonesawMD/status/1996542731649216703?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*sOet-jHm3xR-a59W6xbBDg.png)\n\nThis echoes something I learned years ago from _Atlas Shrugged_. Not the memes, not the politics people project onto it, but the core insight: the world becomes unbearable the moment you let other people's judgments define your sense of self. And it becomes beautiful again the moment you stop performing and return to your own judgment, your own effort, your own values.\n\nAyn Rand's protagonists didn't explain themselves. I always admired how in the book the strongest characters refused to justify themselves. They didn't beg others to understand their choices. They didn't put their dignity up for a vote. They simply acted from conviction. They produced in silence. They carried their burdens quietly. They allowed themselves to be misunderstood, in many cases even hated, because trading integrity for acceptance was never worth the price. The same principle is at play in that tweet.\n\nModern life pushes the opposite. It asks you to announce every effort, justify every choice, prove you're not falling behind. There's pressure to curate an image of momentum even when you're struggling. But personal growth demands the opposite.\n\nIt demands a season where you are willing to look like a loser.\n\nNot ironically.\nNot as a setup for a redemption arc.\nNot with a secret punchline of \"just wait.\"\n\nA season where you can be still. Quiet. Unimpressive.\nA season where people might think you're wasting time.\nA season where you don't defend yourself.\nA season where you don't brag, don't explain, don't narrate your effort.\nA season where you let the ego burn.\n\nBecause in that quiet, I'm sure one discovers the same thing that the man in the tweet discovered, and the same thing Rand's characters lived out: the only transformation that lasts is the one that starts internally. Once the internal picture strengthens, the external commentary loses its power.\n\nI liked how the tweet framed it: don't just resist the urge to explain: observe it. Watch what provokes your need to justify. Notice the moments when you crave someone's approval. Notice when you're tempted to brag about the work you're doing. Those urges aren't random; they're signals revealing where you still feel unacceptable to yourself.\n\nAtlas Shrugged taught me the same lesson via a large novel: until you stop needing others to validate your worth, you cannot build anything great, not a body, not a business, not a life. That's why all the antagonists in her books were constantly thinking about \"how will others judge my actions\".\n\nI really do think there is something to be said about allowing yourself to appear aimless, behind, or unimpressive. It's not regressing, even if it looks that way to others. It is rebuilding the ground floor of your identity, the part that no one sees but everyone eventually feels. That way when the progress finally becomes visible, you hold it differently. You don't flaunt it. You don't cling to it. You don't fear losing it. Because it didn't come from applause. It came from conviction.\n\nThat's the part of _Atlas Shrugged_ people miss: the power wasn't in rejecting the world, it was in no longer needing the world's permission to exist. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is enter a season where you appear to be going nowhere. A good reminder for myself:\n \nBe calm in it.\nBe comfortable in it.\nLet others misunderstand.\nLet the ego panic and then quiet down.\n\nBecause once the internal shift happens, the external world eventually reshapes itself around you, not the other way around. We create with our imagination the world we want. If we are creating things for others, instead of ourself, it should be no surprise when the end product is awful.\n\nThus, I am grateful for the reminder that I need to create things for me, and if other people get value from them great, but that's not the end goal.\n\n12/5/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
