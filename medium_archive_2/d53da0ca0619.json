No one wins votes telling the truth about our fiat monetary system being a ponzi. Though, I do respect the hell out of those who do (Ron Paul being a famous example).\n\nInstead they feed the public a bunch of lies that are not true but sound really good. It's a dirty game, but hopefully the beautiful image above helps you not get fooled by those who seek power.\n\nNo politician is coming to save you, so save yourself. Doing so is freeing :)\n\n10/20/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
