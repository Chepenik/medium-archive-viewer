  "content": "# Day 1367\n\nGoing into the city tonight to hit up Pubkey. Very excited to spend some quality time with my boys. I feel a bit like a kid getting ready to hit the candy shop, and you're going with your Grandma so you know you'll get to each as much as your heart desires.\n\nBeing an adult is cool, but you have to deal with adult stuff. It's not like high school where you had very little responsibility and got to hang with your friends all the time. I guess when you don't have something you appreciate it more is the point.\n\nLife is full of tradeoffs. It's cool having a job and some spending money, it's life changing (in a good way) having children who you love unconditionally and are responsible for, and it's honestly refreshing in many ways knowing you are the CEO of your life, not someone else. Doesn't mean there are not advantages to when we were younger and life was simpler. The times are-ah-changing.\n\n![[https://x.com/KyleTibbitts/status/2001484634287382812?s=20](https://x.com/KyleTibbitts/status/2001484634287382812?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*P7HcIbIr5sNZcI034T3Z1A.png)\n\n12/18/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
