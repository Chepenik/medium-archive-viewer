  "content": "# Day 1261\n\nLast night I said a prayer before we all ate dinner. In that prayer, I asked God to let me shoot par today on the course. Sure enough, my team finished even on the day. Yes, it was a scramble, but God answered my prayer. Maybe not in the way I expected, but in His way. Deep gratitude.\n\n_Isaiah 55:8–9_: _\"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\"_\n\nI had in mind one outcome, me personally shooting par. God had in mind something better: our team coming together, fighting through each hole, and finishing even as one. In all honesty, there was some amazing teamwork displayed today. On hole 3 we used all of my shots and I got a true par, but on the others when I was lagging my teammates picked up the slack. It was a living example of how prayer works. God always answers, but sometimes He answers with a twist that teaches us humility, unity, and gratitude.\n\nJesus Himself taught us in _Matthew 7:7_: _\"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.\"_ That doesn't mean we always receive exactly what we picture, but rather that when we ask, God opens a door. Today that door looked like shared laughter, clutch putts, and a tied match that came down to the very last hole. Pretty funny George asked for four strokes and Connor only gave us three. The extra stroke is what allowed Connor's team to tie the game with a huge birdie putt from Anthony.\n\nReflecting on this great day I am reminded that the beauty of prayer is that it draws us closer to God, regardless of the outcome. If you have faith in the Lord He will hear your prayer. And when He answers differently than we imagined, it's not a \"no\", it's an invitation to trust that He sees a bigger picture.\n\nSo while I didn't shoot par for 9 holes on my own, God showed me that the power of prayer can turn a fun round of golf into a lesson in faith. Next time I pray, I'll remember: the answer may come, but not in the way I expect, and that's okay. Grateful for the time I have been gifted to spend part of it with friends & family in the Outer Banks. It's been a special trip.\n\n![The 1st Annual Corolla Cup Tournament 2025](https://miro.medium.com/1*eORJwDNWlNzrnDqHLv9EGg.png)\n\n9/3/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
