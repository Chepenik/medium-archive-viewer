Written two centuries before ChatGPT learned to rhyme, and it still slaps. I will keep coming back to these four lines like a song I can't get out of my head. They are quite profound.\n\nI don't think Blake is just being cute here. He's stating a law of reality most of us only glimpse in dreams or psychedelics or that weird moment when you stare at a leaf and suddenly feel the whole forest breathing through it. Every part contains the whole. The grain of sand is not a tiny piece of a big world: it is the world, folded up small enough to fit under your fingernail. The wild flower isn't a decoration; it's heaven on a stem, if you've got the eyes for it.\n\nI've been wrestling with this idea recently of every part containing the whole. It feels true in my bones before my brain can catch up. Look at a cell under a microscope and you're looking at a city with highways, factories, libraries of DNA. Look at a galaxy and it's just another cell in something bigger we haven't named yet. Fractals all the way up, fractals all the way down. The mathematicians caught up later, [Mandelbrot](https://grokipedia.com/page/Benoit_Mandelbrot#key-scientific-contributions) and his coastlines that are infinitely long if you keep zooming, but Blake saw it with the naked eye of a lunatic prophet in London, 1803, no microscope required.\n\nWhich seems to imply there is something to be said for emotion. Science is great, so is logic. But sometimes you get a feeling that will never be perfectly articulated by reasoning it out. You just know it deep in your bones. It's like God zapped you with a divine spark and you were open enough to receive the signal. Anyone can be a reddit fact checker. But if you want to seek the Truth you must approach the world with a childlike curiosity and be prepared for the theological gut-punch: if a grain of sand already contains the world, what does that make us? The easy answer: connected.\n\nThe more complex one? Little walking infinities. Dust with delusions of grandeur and, somehow, also the image of the Infinite Itself. Genesis says God shaped us out of dirt and breathed into it. Blake says that dirt was already pregnant with galaxies. So when the Eternal wanted to know what it feels like to stub a toe, to fall in love, to taste coffee, to be terrified of dying, He didn't just make puppets. He stepped into the grain. Became the wild flower. Held eternity in an hour of laughter and tears and boredom and heartbreak.\n\nHumans are the way Infinity learns what finity tastes like.\n\nI mean that makes sense to me. Why not run the simulation? Experience it all, everywhere at once, and make it so most of us don't even realize we are all connected. That thought leaves me stunned and grateful, like I've been handed a cosmic secret I'm not qualified to carry. But yet I am because I've got God inside of me.\n\nIt is kind of weird though to look at my own palm, creased, freckled, ridiculous, and imagine actually holding infinity there. Most days I drop it immediately and use it to scroll Twitter instead. But every once in a while the lines come back uninvited, and for a second the whole damn universe fits right in the center of my hand, pulsing.\n\nConsider that if Blake's words are true then each moment is a microcosm of existence itself. To see the world in a grain of sand is not merely poetic license; it is an invitation to perceive reality as an interconnected, self-referential whole where boundaries dissolve and unity prevails.\n\nConsciousness, no matter how fragmented by ego or distraction, retains the capacity to recognize its origin. So next time you find yourself lost in thought, look down at your palm, and realize it contains everything you need.\n\n12/2/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
