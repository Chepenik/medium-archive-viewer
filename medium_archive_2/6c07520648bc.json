  "content": "# Day 1163\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Ua0Chf_3cCVVbqRE.jpg)\n\nGitHub is full of testnet dreams that never make it to mainnet.\nCool code, clever ideas, but no real-world thrust.\nThat includes 99% of the software I've written myself.\n\nBitcoin? That was code that flew.\nNo VC runway. No CEO. No do-overs.\nJust pure math and open-source code, released into the wild and somehow, it _**worked**._ Adopted by strangers, hardened by time, now running 24/7 across the globe.\n\nWe laugh at these meme planes, but most projects, especially the ones claiming they'll fix the money, end up looking just like them. Bitcoin's the one that actually took off.\n\nI'm forever grateful to Satoshi for his gift to the world.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*3-yC7D5uqwgVCako6qgRTw.png)\n\n5/28/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
