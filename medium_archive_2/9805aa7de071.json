  "content": "# Day 1269\n\n> **James 1:17** - \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\"\n\nDear Lord,\n\nI first want to say thank You for everything You have given me and my family. From my health, to any wealth I've been able to earn, to a beautiful child, another on the way, and a wife who loves me. You have given me my soul, a unique brain, and I'm not ugly, as far as I can tell. You also gave me a sense of humor, which I will forever be grateful for. I know You have one too, and it is one of the things I appreciate most about You.\n\nI come to You today asking for the safe delivery of my son, Ryder Jay Chepenik, and a smooth birth for his mother. I'll never know what it's like to grow a human and deliver him from your body. It's pretty incredible that You gave women the ability to do so, and I can confirm it changed my life for the better after my wife did so with our first daughter, Sloan.\n\nYou have already given me so much. When I pray, it feels selfish sometimes because I say \"I\" a lot...I want this and I want that. If You weren't the Alpha and Omega of everything that is, I imagine You would get tired and annoyed, just like how I sometimes get annoyed when my child isn't listening to me.\n\nBut I think being a parent brings you closer to You, God, because you see a glimpse of what it means to create something truly unique, something truly special and worth caring for. It's a blessing unlike anything I can describe. I feel Your presence, Lord, running down my spine when I pray. Usually I keep these conversations between us, but tonight I didn't have anything else to say other than to ask for Your blessing. For a healthy birth. It is coming so fast and I am so excited to meet my son in person.\n\nAs I've noted, You have given me such an incredible amount, and I'm incredibly grateful. I feel so blessed and so fortunate. It is only because of You that I've been able to accomplish any of it. But I come to You again asking for more. Please let my baby boy be delivered safely, please give him the knowledge to thrive in this fallen world, and please give me the strength, wisdom, and courage to lead my family the way You would want me to.\n\nJesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me and my family. We are all sinners (maybe Ryder is not a sinner yet, but I'm sure he will quickly learn to hit from his sister 😂  and yes we are working on teaching Sloan not to hit as you know) who don't deserve Your grace, but You gave it to us, and the world anyway. You sacrificed Your only Son so we could have redemption. I have sinned in the past, and while I am trying to live a holier life as I get to know You more deeply, I know I will fall short again. Yet You love me still. Your mercy is new every morning, and Your grace is unlike anything humanity has ever experienced.\n\nTo anyone reading this, I can confirm that once you have children, once you experience a role in the act of creation, it will change you in ways that are hard to put into words. But the best way I can describe it is this: you will understand, in a profound and undeniable way, that there is a Creator who made this all possible. The miracle of new life, the overwhelming love you feel, the protective instinct that rises within you...these are but glimpses of God's heart for us. Through becoming a parent, I've come to know You not just as Lord, but as Father.\n\nHelp me to teach my children about Your love and Your ways. Let them see You reflected in how I love their mother and how I serve others. When I stumble, as I surely will, remind me that Your forgiveness is already there, waiting for me to accept it. Guide my steps as a father, a husband, and a man trying to follow You.\n\nI trust in Your perfect plan for my family, even when I can't see the path ahead. Thank You for the gift of faith, for the privilege of prayer, and for the promise that You hear every word I speak to You.\n\n> **1 John 5:14–15** - \"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.\"\n\nIn Your Holy Name I pray. Amen.\n\n9/11/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
