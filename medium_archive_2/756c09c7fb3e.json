  "content": "# Day 1319\n\nHow blessed am I to get to experience my kids growing up? To take them trick or treating in a good neighborhood. To have extended family literally come all the way down to Florida to help us with Ryder while he is a new born.\n\nI do not take any of it for granted. It's easy to overlook all our blessings. Part of life is getting used to things. Getting in a routine. But whenever you feel in a rut start counting your blessings.\n\nIt's impossible to be grateful and upset at the same time. I can confirm I'm feeling the former tonight after a good Halloween 🧡\n\n10/31/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
