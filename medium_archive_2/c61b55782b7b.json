  "content": "# Day 1193\n\nDear Heavenly Father,\n\nPlease give me the agency to do the things I know I can do. The courage to stand up for what is right, to lead my household, and to do the right thing - not the easy thing, when faced with hard choices. Give me the discipline to craft a strong body, a bright mind, and keep a sense of calm and peace when others provoke me. Finally, I ask for Your Grace when I fall short.\n\nIn Jesus name I pray.\n\nAmen.\n\n6/27/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
