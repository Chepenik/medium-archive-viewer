  "content": "# Day 1310\n\nMan what a roller coaster of emotions it is when your child's birth is near and I say this as the man. I just act as support for the woman who has to do all the heavy lifting. Can only imagine what Paige is feeling right now.\n\nDear Lord please give my wife a safe, happy, healthy birth tomorrow. I can't thank you enough for all the blessings you have given us. In your name, Jesus Christ, the King of kings, we pray.\n\nBeyond excited to meet my little boy, Ryder, tomorrow. The future is bright :)\n\n10/22/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
