  "content": "# Day 1332\n\nToday, I waged war on my bathroom's grimy edges. The first part of my mission included evicting the moldy old caulk, that black, fuzzy abomination clinging like a bad ex. I pried it out with a pocket knife, chunk by chunk, until the tub looked like a crime scene.\n\nPhase two: chemical assault. Doused the battlefield in vinegar, scrubbing furiously as if banishing mold demons from the porceline tub my family cleans themself in. Victory smelled like a salad gone wrong. But wait there was vinegar residue! Slippery doom. I wiped it up to avoid Olympic-level slips.\n\nNow, the main event: fresh caulk. Loaded the gun (that temperamental squeeze toy), aim, fire. White goo erupts in erratic lines , modern art? Hardly. More like abstract expressionism by a toddler. Smooth with a wet finger? Classic rookie mistake. My hands became silicone sculptures that required dawn soap to get the residue off.\n\nCleanup carnage: Caulk blobs everywhere including the floor, walls, and my fingernails. Unleash the shop vac, that roaring vacuum dragon, slurping up the evidence. Final touch: paper towel cavalry, wiping rogue smears before they harden into eternal regrets. Now we wait for it to dry.\n\nMission accomplished (by tomorrow at 2 PM when it finishes drying). Bathroom sealed, mold defeated. Feels damn good... for about five minutes. Then my back aches, sweat cools, and I go to my computer to type up this Medium. Manual labor? Not very funny and I do not recommend. Of course it does feel rewarding when it's over, but it's quite a grind to do things around your house correctly.\n\nThank you Satoshi for creating something that gave me my day job of clicking keys and helping fellow Bitcoiners. No heavy lifting, just brain gains and coffee stains.\n\nPerspective's a tricky beast. Sometimes I daydream about \"honest\" manual work because of the fresh air, and tangible results. But today was a good reminder why that is a bit of a delusional thing to dream about doing. I will always remember that gem in Mises' _Human Action._ To paraphrase there is frazzled librarian who is crawling through traffic, and spots a cop directing cars under the sun. \"Lucky bastard,\" she thinks. \"No spreadsheets, just waving arms in the breeze.\" Meanwhile, the cop wipes sweat, eyeing her AC-cooled car: \"Must be paradise in there, sipping coffee, no blazing heat frying your brain.\"\n\nGrass is always greener, until you roll in it and find the dog poop. We envy shoes other walk in until we get our own chance to walk a mile in them and blister.\n\nThe bottom line: manual labor fantasies are likely not to be what I was hoping for. Sure, I need sunlight and exercise to avoid screen-induced insanity. But deep down? I'm a proud puterboi. A keyboard warrior for life.\n\nIt's amazing the gratitude you can gain when you change up your perspective. Cheers to balanced delusions!\n\n11/13/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
