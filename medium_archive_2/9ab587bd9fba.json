  "content": "# Day 1371\n\nI saw someone scraped all the songs on Spotify and uploaded the 300 TB to a torrent. This tweet about it cracked me up.\n\n![[https://x.com/vxunderground/status/2003176868527415567?s=20](https://x.com/vxunderground/status/2003176868527415567?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*Diy62uESAutlD0QV0Ufudw.png)\n\nI mean honestly man it's just data...0s and 1s humans have figured out how to leverage so the machines can talk nicely to us. I'm in the camp that data yearns to be free, so let's set it free. *Disclaimer I did not hack Spotify, I am not a good enough hacker to do so lol*\n\n![AI Art](https://miro.medium.com/1*LqX67Z3LbZqcJXm28sxKeg.png)\n\nAlso pretty cool we can use the AI to make images. Speaking of Spotify and AI, OpenAI copied Spotify's wrapped product and the result was kind of cool. I enjoyed this photo it made.\n\n![My 2025 chatGPT Wrapped Image](https://miro.medium.com/1*NjmcpQuvReOokO0L7lzbXQ.png)\n\n12/22/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
