  "content": "Day 1198\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*TojgiBzXbBXsrUTtmgIrQw@2x.jpeg)\n\nIf anyone wonders why I'm constantly talking about Bitcoin, well this is why. We don't have to play zero sum games.\n\nLet's play win win games.\n\nDon't trust me though, please go verify for yourself.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*CCQgV1y9MrR2uHRVkc8Zsw@2x.jpeg)\n\nI will conclude by noting it's insane 2050 is closer than 2000 is. I saw that on Twitter today and thought damn I'm getting old.\n\nI wager by 2050 no one will take USD for BTC because USD will be worthless. My 2 sats.\n\n7/2/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
