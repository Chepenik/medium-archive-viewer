  "content": "# Day 1158\n\nToday was a busy day, but a great one. Started work at 6 AM so I can head into NYC tonight and hit up my favorite bar: Pubkey. Always a treat getting to visit one of the top Bitcoin bars in the country.\n\nThere is such a unique vibe to this area of the USA: the Tri-state area. I love the granite rocks and the mountains. It's not exactly the most walkable area where my wife's family lives, but it's gorgeous and they have a massive yard. Since I work remote I really need to take advantage of the fact I can travel around. It is so cool getting to experience the country. I think it's also healthy for both Sloan and my wife to see this side of the family since they get to see my side all the time because we live in the same city as my parents.\n\nAnyways, today I will keep this one short because I've got places to be and things to see! Tomorrow I plan to work more on my Bitcoin children's book. It is not going to create itself! Someone has to educaute the youth. :)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*q1m7HJXJY3MOszRIeoQEow.png)\n\n5/23/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
