  "content": "# Day 1365\n\n![It is true!](https://miro.medium.com/1*hh0gsXuYVR3_JHq45NBDFg.png)\n\n![This is a metaphor for humans. Medication often does not address the root cause of the issue](https://miro.medium.com/1*VMeT7pirjlLJNhyx9cdR4w.png)\n\nThe axe forgets, but the tree remembers. Me talking to the doctor who circumcised me 28 years ago. HAHAHHAHAHHAhaha, kidding. While I do agree the tree typically remembers, I was barely older than a seed at that point. Still, it is a profound quote. How often the perpetrator of violence forgets their act of aggression, while the one who received it does not. Something to keep in mind, and a reminder to forgive.\n\nThat's right, doc. I forgive you for mutilating me. And luckily, that trauma will not be passed down in my family. My boy was not mutilated. Anyway, I did not mean to come on here and start talking about genital foreskin. It just came to mind because that quote is something I have been seeing everywhere.\n\nI saw something the other day about how the algos are making us all alike, pushing the same slop down our throats and preventing people from expressing their uniqueness. In a world being flooded with synthetic content, there is real alpha in being able to make unique stuff.\n\nAI is a tool. Smart people will leverage it to build immense systems of value. It is worth playing around with. My advice though...Leverage your uniqueness! Use the tools to further the stuff that fascinates you. Create things that you love and share them. I imagine that in a world of deepfakes, authenticity will be incredibly valuable.\n\nBreak out of the algoslop.\n\nEmbrace your inner weird.\n\nEven if people do not like it, at least you do.\n\nMake your younger self proud.\n\n12/16/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
