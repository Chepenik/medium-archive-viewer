And that would be children.\n\nOf course you should still get a 3D printer. When you have one you can create anything you can dream up. Except a child of course. But still 3D printers are amazing. Incredible for prototyping.\n\nSo PSA - Get a 3D printer and have kids. Life is better with them.\n\nBoth 3D printers and kids of course.\n\n8/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
