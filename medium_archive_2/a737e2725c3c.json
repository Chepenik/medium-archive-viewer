  "content": "# Day 1301\n\nDay 1 of pat leave. Man it's nice having extra time to enjoy a slow morning, read, work on random projects I've been meaning to do, and enjoy a nice dinner with my family.\n\nYet, it's 8:30 and my little one is crying and honestly I'm exhausted from a full day. So alas it's time to go to sleep. Until tomorrow anon.\n\n10/13/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
