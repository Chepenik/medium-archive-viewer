  "content": "# Day 1311\n\nPassing time in the sterile hum of a hospital room, I am struck by an age-old truth: _Man makes plans and God laughs_. A home birth was our intention because it's intimate and familiar but Divine providence steered us here. In this midway space between plan and reality, I find solace in the knowledge that my prayers for safety, joy, and health are not unheard.\n\nWe are a people of structure, of schedules and checklists, yet life often unfolds as an act of grace; unpredictable, sovereign. When I got to enjoy the Outer Banks with Paige's family last month, I offered up a prayer over dinner: that we might shoot par on the greens the following day. A scramble later, our foursome achieved it, a collective triumph, not individual perfection. The lesson was clear: God answers prayers in ways that transcend personal expectation, often through community and providence.\n\nToday, I stand at the threshold of fatherhood again, with a name, Ryder Jay Chepenik, in my heart and a faith that surpasses uncertainty. This birth will be what it must be; my role is to trust in the One who creates life itself. Parenting reveals God's fingerprint on existence: we become more attuned to His divine order as we witness the miracle of new life, the wonder of rebirth through innocence. Children see the world anew, unburdened by preconception or jaded familiarity, and remind us what it means to be fully present.\n\nAs I await Ryder's arrival, I am struck by the paradox: while I have experienced fatherhood before, this moment is entirely novel. Every birth is a first, the first breath, the first cry, the first gasp of air that signals life's unbreakable covenant with its Creator. My prayer today mirrors my trust in Divine providence:\n\nO Alpha and Omega, King of kings, You who sustain all things by Your will, grant this child safe passage into the world. Strengthen Paige as she labors; soften my heart to be her unwavering support. Let Ryder enter this life with joy, his spirit unscathed from the womb's embrace to the earth's nurture. In Your hallowed name I entreat: Amen.\n\nRest comes now, for soon I will stand at Paige's side, her shield and comfort, as we welcome Ryder Jay into the light of day.\n\n10/23/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
