I snuggled my child back to sleep in the middle of the night and felt that tiny body melt into my arms, after she woke up in a fright because I was not in the bed. In those quiet moments, everything becomes obvious. All the noise, all the panic, all the headlines melt away. This is the real wealth of life. This is what I am trying to protect. Children are a blessing.\n\nIt makes one think, if moments like that are the center of a meaningful existence, then what are the forces pushing people away from family, away from stability, away from confidence in the future. I don't think most people are choosing to be childless because they do not want children. They are being conditioned to fear the cost of life itself. They are being told stability is unattainable. They are being taught that the world is too chaotic to plant roots. All of that is downstream of one thing: most tools we have been given to navigate our lives with are extremely corrupted.\n\nMoney is the clearest example. At its most basic level money is supposed to be nothing more than a tool. A simple technology that helps people trade, cooperate, and build. A good monetary system lowers friction. A good monetary system makes it easier for ordinary people to plan, save, and raise families. A good monetary system amplifies human potential.\n\nBut that is not what we live under. Our current system was not built to empower people. It was built to extract from them. Once you realize that inflation is not an accident but a mechanism, everything snaps into focus. The debasement never stops. The purchasing power never stabilizes. Every year your labor buys less. Every year the political class grows richer while telling you things are fine. It is theft disguised as policy. And the people hit the hardest are usually the ones who are working the hardest. Communism is awful, but man, I can sympathize with labor when we are all dealing with crony capitalism. I love free markets, not markets where the powers that be get to privatize the gains and socialize the losses.\n\nThis type of environment doesn't just drain bank accounts. It drains confidence. It makes people paranoid about the future. It makes them feel like they can never get ahead no matter how much they sacrifice. It turns ambition into anxiety and dreams into debt. It traps people in jobs they hate because they cannot imagine any other outcome. It hollows out the middle of society and concentrates power in a small group of bureaucrats and insiders who treat the entire system like their personal casino.\n\nOnce you see it, you cannot unsee it. And once you understand that the system is behaving exactly as designed, you start looking for tools that are designed differently.\n\nBitcoin is that tool. For me it is not an investment strategy or a speculative gamble. It is the most honest monetary system I have ever encountered. A form of money that cannot be manipulated by politicians. Gold was a far better tool than fiat because at least it imposed discipline, but even gold broke once the world went digital. It centralized in vaults, it became abstracted through paper claims, and it eventually became another lever for the same people who debase everything they touch. Bitcoin fixes the part gold could never solve. It is savings that cannot be diluted or stolen. It is property no bank can freeze. It gives people something the fiat world works relentlessly to take away. It gives them an exit. It gives them breathing room. It gives them the ability to plan further out than two weeks. It gives them the confidence to build a life instead of constantly defending one.\n\nBitcoin is a vote against the parasitic financial architecture that has been draining the working class for decades. It is a return to personal responsibility and personal sovereignty. It is the rediscovery of what money is supposed to be.\n\nAI is heading toward a similar crossroads. Like money, it is a tool. The question is what kind of tool it will become. Used correctly, AI is an amplifier. It enhances your ability to think, research, write, create, and build. It can become a personal intelligence that grows with you. But used incorrectly, it becomes the same centralizing force fiat became. When a small group of companies owns the model, the data, and the inputs, they own the direction of human thought. They shape language. They shape cognition. They turn minds into outsourced processes instead of engines of creativity.\n\nThe goal should never be to use AI as a replacement for thinking. The goal is to use AI as a mirror, as a collaborator, as a cognitive multiplier. That only works if the tool is self-sovereign. That means private. That means local. That means open source. That means the intelligence you rely on belongs to you alone. It learns from you, grows with you, and cannot be subpoenaed or repurposed against you. A good reminder to myself that perfect is the enemy of the good. It's okay to use the frontier models, but I should also rely on my local ones as well. Good to train myself to first use the local models as much as possible and only turn to the web based ones when I'm stuck and need more compute. This is especially important in regards to conversations that need to be kept out of surveilled AI.\n\nIn both cases, whether money or AI, the lesson is the same. Tools matter. Their design determines whether they empower you or extract from you. Fiat money removes agency. Closed AI removes agency. Bitcoin restores it. Self-sovereign AI will restore it.\n\nWhen I think back to holding my child tonight, the clarity is overwhelming. My responsibility is not only to raise her. It is to build a world where she can stand on her own feet without being preyed upon by systems designed to weaken her. A world where the tools she relies on work in her favor. A world that rewards thought instead of discouraging it. A world where sovereignty is normal.\n\nThe future will be shaped by the tools we choose. I want the tools that amplify human dignity. I want the tools that make it easier to build a family and live a meaningful life. I want tools that strengthen the individual instead of dissolving them. Bitcoin does that. Self-sovereign AI will do that. And when I hold my child, peaceful and safe, the path forward becomes obvious.\n\nThis is the world I want for her. This is the world I am trying to build. Let's build it!\n\n![Love Me A Good Pepe Meme](https://miro.medium.com/1*SyHuLTIJCYiaQts29-mTWA@2x.jpeg)\n\n11/24/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
