  "content": "# Day 1257\n\nDrove from Jax to North Carolina today with the family. We split up the road trip and stopped in Savannah for lunch. Do recommend doing if you have the time to stop. Much nicer to make periodic stops rather than drive all the way through. Savannah is such a cool historic town. I took this picture of a ferry from the breakfast place we decided to eat lunch.\n\n![A cool boat in Savannah](https://miro.medium.com/0*idNDeFlVAH_0SKlW.jpg)\n\nAfter we ate we walked along the waterfront and got to see the boat up close. Would love to take a river tour in Savannah one day.\n\n![Me & my lil lady](https://miro.medium.com/1*aWLIUfc89U29kLITpL9lyQ.png)\n\nAnyways, we are now getting ready to sleep at the hotel and I'm grateful we made it safely. Tomorrow will be in the outerbanks for a week to hang with Paige's family. Looking forward to spending some time on the beach. Life is good.\n\n8/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
