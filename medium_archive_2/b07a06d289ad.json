  "content": "# Day 1176\n\nI saw a clip the other day of Bill Ackman talking about a rough stretch in his life. To stay grounded, he focused on improving just 0.1% every day. A tiny amount, almost imperceptible, but that was the point. It was doable. Manageable. Something he could stick with.\n\nAnd over time, that tiny edge started to compound. What looked like nothing at first began to build. Then it took off, exponentially.\n\nIt's a powerful way to think about progress. Whether it's work, health, relationships, or learning: momentum matters. Improvement stacks. The secret is to keep showing up.\n\nGet a little better every day. Even just 0.1%. It adds up in a way that eventually changes everything.\n\nLately, I've been trying to live that out. I've started exercising more and when I do my body rewards me by making the rest of the day just flow better. I sleep easier. Work feels lighter. I show up with more energy.\n\nI've also been doing small things to help my wife, tidy up here, handle something before she asks. Nothing huge. But it all connects. Movement creates momentum. The effort you make in one part of your life spills over into the others.\n\nIt's not about massive change overnight. It's about the little things, done consistently. They don't seem like much at first.\n\nBut give them time and they'll transform you.\n\n![Exponential growth](https://miro.medium.com/1*YmEbkzOBjehl4Mzugmgmpw.png)\n\n6/10/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
