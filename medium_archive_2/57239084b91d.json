  "content": "# Day 1293\n\nI am going to turn Saylorscope into a beautiful finance app people use to understand this.\n\n![[https://x.com/ten31funds/status/1975033477105070082](https://x.com/ten31funds/status/1975033477105070082)](https://miro.medium.com/1*hry_Xt5FY1afoSyk74EAdw.png)\n\nConsider it materialized, because I've now written down the goal in cyberSpace. It exists now as both 1s and 0s in a computer and also in my brain. Also at [https://www.saylorscope.com/](https://www.saylorscope.com/) but it's about to get an AI upgrade thanks to Replit.\n\nMore soon >:)\n\nAlso I bought some options contracts on Kalshi tonight:\n\n![ref link: kalshi.com/sign-up/?referral=ced5940a-4caf-45a5-a51a-44dc89e45593](https://miro.medium.com/1*g9oJMaPYzCPOsvwWLg8qLA.png)\n\nThe best thing to do is buy bitcoin and self custody it. That is savings. The above is 100% percent gambling. With that noted, I think that's easy money.\n\n![150k before Dec 6 is my guess, but luckily I have until 2026](https://miro.medium.com/1*jl0rzZ71yM53bRRWsJbAfg.png)\n\n10/5/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
