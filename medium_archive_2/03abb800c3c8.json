  "content": "# Day 1358\n\nHad salad, steak, lobster, deviled eggs, and twice baked potatoes for dinner at my Grandparents. Man am I blessed.\n\nAfter dinner I went for a walk and [enjoyed a podcast about The Network State.](https://youtu.be/zfyapWAvVxM)\n\n**Thus I Present To You, Anon, Seven Mechanisms for What the Post-Fiat World Might Look Like**\n\n![Ai Art of a Future City and half a Marble Statue](https://miro.medium.com/1*v0PCMwhtkJjc-El1fSErcw.jpeg)\n\nThe 20th-century political operating system is clearly failing. Its replacement will not be another nation-state. It will be a new form built on hard money, digital communities, and the insolvency of legacy institutions.\n\nHere are the seven mechanisms to help explain the transition based on the podcast linked above.\n\n1. **The Network State: From Digital Community to Physical Territory** \nStart online. Build a aligned digital community. Establish physical nodes worldwide (corporate-campus scale, not embassies). Accumulate capital using modern coordination tools and non-inflatable money. When bankrupt states can no longer afford territory, crowdfund the purchase of peninsulas or islands. Egypt's sale of Ras al-Hikma to the UAE in 2024 is the working template. Digital coordination plus hard money enables populations to acquire land and then materialize their social network into sovereign territory.\n\n2. **Hard Money Revives Territory Sales** \nFiat money let 20th-century states fund endless war and welfare by printing. That era is over. Sovereign debt levels are now mathematically un-payable. Insolvent states will sell assets for hard currency the way every bankrupt entity eventually does. Historical precedents: Louisiana Purchase, Alaska, post-Soviet fire sales. Territory sales are not science fiction. They are simply unfamiliar to a generation raised during the fiat experiment. Bitcoin ends the premise of 20th-century state finance and reopens the land market.\n\n3. **The Great Inversion: Zombie America, Functional China**The standard narrative has it backward. The US increasingly resembles late-stage Soviet communism: prices detached from reality, talent diverted into financial games, infrastructure projects that cost billions and deliver nothing. China's edge is not authoritarianism. It is external market discipline. Chinese firms must satisfy real international customers who pay in real money. American institutions optimize for printed dollars and regulatory capture. Result: China builds cities and factories. America builds legal rackets on a shrinking productive base. I hate to recognize as an American Maximalist, but I'm also not going to shy away from the evidence. Important caveat, I am incredibly bullish on what Americans, especially those who embrace Bitcoin, can accomplish. Americans are simply goated.\n\n4. **The Subscription State** \nCoercive taxation fails when wealth is mobile and money is hard. You cannot tax what you cannot see or seize. The new model is voluntary subscription. Citizens pay for services they want. Stop paying, services stop. Start again, services resume. Exactly like any successful online platform. Minimal overhead, no forced redistribution, explicit consent at every level.\n\n5. **Dollar Collapse and American Realignment** \nThe dollar is the last glue holding the United States together. Saif & Balaji agree, and if I'm being honest I would say I do too. Red and blue America no longer share families, social circles, or basic assumptions. Remove the shared currency and the country fragments. Likely realignment: right embraces Bitcoin and digital sovereignty. Left, dependent on imports and stability, drifts toward alignment with the last remaining industrial power (China). Current political tribes dissolve into monetary tribes.\n\n6. **The Security Vacuum** \nWhen central authority fails, private security does not magically scale. You get 1990s Russia: mafias, gangs, protection rackets. True security requires a competent monopoly on violence. As American order erodes, millions will exit to jurisdictions that still provide it: Singapore, UAE, El Salvador, red states, wherever rule of law survives. The migration will not be ideological. It will be primal. I am actually more bullish on a U.S with stronger state powers, which in turn attracts more capital, safer cities, and better policy. I think we are already starting to see this play out across the U.S since Covid (2020).\n\n7. **Legitimacy via Social Smart Contract** \nDemocracy inside one monopoly state is broken. Real democracy happens between states, by exit. Balaji's network state model formalizes this: citizens sign on-chain contracts upon entry, pledge entrance fees from their wallets, and explicitly accept jurisdictional rules. This creates cryptographically verifiable consent, a.k.a bilateral obligations, where both citizen and state are bound. Governance becomes a competitive market: jurisdictions function as service providers, citizens as consumers selecting among options. The smart contract records participation, establishes clear limits on state power, and proves legitimacy through voluntary choice rather than coerced residence. Saif agrees on the exit-driven competition outcome but differs on mechanism. He views Bitcoin's removal of fiat inflation as sufficient catalyst, eliminating monetary garbage forces governments to compete naturally without requiring sophisticated technical architectures. Where Balaji sees smart contracts as necessary infrastructure for legitimate new states, Saif sees sound money restoring traditional competitive governance by destroying the monopoly power fiat grants states. If I had to guess Balaji's approach is more likely to manifest. The term \"monarchy\" carries too much historical weight, most people won't voluntarily opt into something called a kingdom. But the semantics obscure the substance: what matters is governance by someone with long time horizons and low time preference. We might not call it monarchy, but the winning jurisdictions will function like modern versions of one, with stable leadership that is thinking decades ahead rather than election cycles.\n\n**The Phase Shift**\n\n20th century: fiat money, unlimited state power, coercive taxation, geography as prison. \n21st century: hard money, constrained states, subscription services, geography as choice.\n\nThe old container is empty. \nThe new operating system is already booting. \nExit the dying systems. \nBuild the replacement.\n\n![Bullish!](https://miro.medium.com/1*6o3BkRBnV_LEd6tSMnKWrQ.png)\n\n12/9/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
