  "content": "# Day 1349\n\nMan getting paid in bitcoin is a cheat code to life. Provide value to others and price your services in hard money. Thank me later anon!\n\n![[https://x.com/NobodyCaribou/status/1995194725155184815?s=20](https://x.com/NobodyCaribou/status/1995194725155184815?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ntXATFT3WPRx6pZ82j1eTw.png)\n\nIn other news a friend of mine tweeted this out and it made my Day. Grateful to Bitcoiners spreading the good word and purchasing my coloring book. I must say Bitcoiners are some of the best people I know. They are generous, kind, and having babies like crazy.\n\nBullish on Bitcoiners building a better world for our kids.\n\n11/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
