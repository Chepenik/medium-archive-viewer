Got Bitcoin?](https://miro.medium.com/1*4zdoMyoWTG49qvdF-k1Y4g.png)\n\nThere seems to be a quiet realization spreading among many young people, which is that the \"deal\" society is offering no longer works. For generations in the West, the social contract felt straightforward and trustworthy. Work hard. Get educated. Build skills. Buy a home. Save. Delay gratification. The idea was that the future would reward you. Time itself was the asset, and if you put in the years, life compounded.\n\nSadly, that contract is breaking. Recent posts I've seen on X describe the feeling as time breaking, or time compression. The idea is unsettling, but intuitive once you sit with it. AI collapses time horizons. It simulates competence instantly. Years of training, apprenticeship, and gradual mastery are bypassed by machines that can now do entry level work for a fraction of the cost, without lunch breaks, without bathroom breaks, and without burnout.\n\nWhen competence becomes instant, patience stops paying. Apprenticeships start to look inefficient. Entry level roles continue to disappear. Debt is no longer amortizing against a stable future because the future keeps changing before the bill comes due. Education, once a ladder, now often functions as an IOU written against a job market that no longer exists by the time graduation arrives.\n\nThis will not just be a labor issue, it is becoming a meaning crisis. Purpose requires continuity. It requires believing that effort today connects to outcomes tomorrow. When that thread snaps, people will not just feel poorer, they will feel hopeless.\n\nAI intensifies the fracture. On paper, productivity is exploding. One person can now do the work of ten in software, design, media, and operations. But behind that efficiency sits an enormous debt engine. Companies are borrowing hundreds of billions to build data centers, train models, and secure infrastructure. Total AI related capital expenditure will be measured in the trillions soon, assuming it is not already. The world's largest company by market cap is currently Nvidia, which tells you exactly where capital believes the future is being built.\n\nDebt pushes asset prices higher. Housing, equities, and anything scarce inflate first. Wages lag. Even when pay increases, it feels fake because the cost of everything that actually matters rises faster. I see this in my own life. It is insane how quickly a quick grocery run for a few items turns into a $100 dollar plus bill. Homeownership slips out of reach for the vast majority of young adults unless their parents step in. Retirement math stops making sense. Saving feels like running on a treadmill that gains speed every day. As a result, the line between saving and investing becomes completely blurred.\n\nStudent debt compounds the damage. Young people graduate into an AI disrupted job market with monthly obligations anchored to an older reality. Miss payments and credit collapses. Lose credit and you lose access to cars, housing, and basic mobility. The old promise that education equals upward mobility fails in real time, in front of everyone.\n\nThis is part of why resentment is growing and trust in institutions is collapsing. Everything has become financialized. Time. Housing. Attention. Creativity. People work harder yet feel poorer because the system extracts yield everywhere. The reward structure tilts toward leverage, speculation, and visibility rather than patient value creation.\n\nSo it should not surprise anyone that risk seeking behavior is exploding. Leveraged trading on perpetual DEXs. Prediction markets. Leveraged bets on politics, prices, and narratives. Platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are seeing massive growth, not because people are reckless by nature, but because the old safe paths no longer feel safe.\n\nWhen starting a legitimate business feels blocked by regulation, capital costs, and time, gambling starts to look rational. Not good, but rational under the circumstances. This is the bad kind of risk. Not the kind where you build something useful. The kind where you try to jump the line because the line no longer moves.\n\nI sympathize deeply with this impulse, even if I do not endorse it. To be fair, I do find it fun to throw a few hundred dollars on perp DEXs or prediction markets. Yet I often lose, and I'm reminded why I would have been better off just saving in bitcoin anyway. That experience reinforces why I still believe Bitcoin is the exit. Not as a get rich scheme, but as a bet on a much more hopeful future. Bitcoin offers humanity a monetary system where savings cannot be diluted. Where effort stored today remains effort tomorrow. Where IOUs are not created out of thin air, where money is not debt based, and where settlement is final.\n\nI also understand why many people cannot see Bitcoin for what it really is yet. Bitcoin already looks large in nominal terms, which triggers cognitive bias. People struggle to grasp exponential networks once they pass a certain scale. Some do not even realize you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin. Others do, but still think, \"If Bitcoin is trading around $87,000 and it does a 2x, my $100 only becomes $200. Why not buy this ten cent meme coin that could do a 100x and turn my $100 into $10,000?\" Not realizing that the most likely outcome is that $100 turning into zero.\n\nBitcoin also demands study to hold through volatility. Most people do not stumble into understanding monetary history, incentives, energy, and cryptography by accident. It takes time in a world that feels like it is running out of time.\n\nWe are in an in between phase right now. A fourth turning, if you will. The old model is dying. The new one is not fully formed or widely understood. In that gap, people detach. Some turn to speculation. Some turn to extremism. Some try to build parallel systems outside the decaying structure.\n\nI do not think any of this is irrational. It is what happens when the future stops honoring its debts. The question now is not whether the social contract broke. That part is obvious. The question is whether we rebuild one that restores continuity, meaning, and honest time, or whether we keep compressing until nothing long term makes sense at all.\n\nHistory suggests the answer will be forced. As the saying goes, pain is the best teacher. The real uncertainty is how much damage accumulates before we finally learn the lesson.\n\n12/27/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
