It's not financial. It's the quiet starvation of light.\n\nWe spend our days indoors, under fluorescent ceilings or cold LED panels, squinting at screens that blast our retinas with synthetic blue light while starving us of the full spectrum of the sun. Most processed lights are sterile, unbalanced, and disconnected from the rhythms that shaped life itself.\n\nJust as processed food has stripped nutrition from our diet, processed light has stripped vitality from our days. The result? Fatigue that coffee can't fix. Sleep that never feels deep. Anxiety that hums beneath everything.\n\n**The Medicine Hiding Outside Your House**\n\nJacob Liberman's book _Light: Medicine of the Future_ argues that sunlight is more than just illumination, it's information. Every wavelength tells your body something. The cells in your eyes, skin, and even your brain respond to it. Light guides hormone release, mood regulation, and the natural timing of sleep and wake cycles.\n\nThe modern environment has broken that dialogue. When we block sunlight during the day and blast artificial light at night, our biology loses the script.\n\nBut the fix isn't high tech. It's ancient. Step outside. Look toward the morning sky. Let your eyes (without sunglasses) meet natural light. Even five minutes can help your circadian rhythm recalibrate. Do not let perfect be the enemy of small improvements. Every little bit you do to improve your light environment compounds.\n\n**Reclaiming Natural Light Indoors**\n\nIf you can't always be in the sun, you can still build a healthier light environment at home. Replace harsh LEDs with incandescent or halogen bulbs. Their warm, continuous spectrum mimics firelight and feels _alive_.\n\nI switched my home to incandescent bulbs, and the change was immediate. My evenings felt calmer. The light had weight and warmth. My eyes relaxed. I slept better.\n\nSimple adjustments make a big difference:\n\n- **Morning:** Open blinds right after waking. Step outside to set your circadian clock.\n\n- **Afternoon:** Take breaks in real sunlight, even through a window won't do; glass blocks key UV and infrared wavelengths.\n\n- **Evening:** Dim lights and switch to warmer tones. Think candlelight, not operating room.\n\n- **Night:** Avoid bright screens or use blue light blockers. Let darkness do its healing work.\n\n**Beyond Biology**\n\nLight shapes emotion, attention, and even meaning. Sunlight on your skin is a reminder that you're part of something larger, a living world that runs on rhythm and resonance.\n\nWe don't just need light to see; we need it to _be seen_ by nature itself. To stay synchronized with the pulse that keeps life balanced.\n\nWhen you reclaim your relationship with light, you don't just improve your sleep or mood. You begin to feel aligned again. Like tuning an instrument that had gone slightly off-key.\n\n**The Path Forward**\n\nYou don't need permission or technology to start. Getting sunlight is free. Just go outside. The bulbs in your home can be changed. Amazon has pretty cheap [incandescent lights](https://amzn.to/4nu3HvJ). The hardest part is remembering that something so simple could matter so much.\n\nWe've outsourced too many aspects of our lives to artificial substitutes: money, food, connection, and even light. Maybe health isn't about adding more complexity, but removing distortions and letting truth shine through again. To reach enLIGHTenment maybe it starts with allowing better light into your life.\n\nSo tomorrow morning, step outside. Let the light hit your face. That's not just sunshine you feel. It is natures medicine.\n\n10/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
