I was literally taking out my trash tonight, thinking about how I needed to mow my lawn as I grabbed the can from my backyard, when it hit me like a ton of bricks. Stephen A. Smith was absolutely right about something. He once told a story on the PBD podcast about how when he first bought his house, a neighbor came up to him all excited: \"Oh s***, Stephen A. Smith! So cool to see you, I'm a big fan!\" But instead of basking in the glory, Stephen A. stopped the guy and said, \"Hey, that's great man, but what's the deal with your yard? Your grass is growing over the fence.\" For the first time in his life, Stephen A. actually _cared_ about property values and neighborhood maintenance because he finally had skin in the game. He had real ownership. And that's when it hit me with this profound realization: more money really does equal more problems, but not for the reasons most people think.\n\nIt's not actually \"more money, more problems.\" It's more like \"more money equals more stuff, which equals more responsibility, which then equals more problems.\" See the difference? When you don't own anything, you've got fewer worries. Your landlord deals with the broken water heater. Someone else worries about the roof. But the moment you have equity, the moment you have ownership, suddenly you're the one lying awake at 2 AM wondering if that weird noise is the furnace dying. It's like entropy has a personal vendetta against homeowners. The grass grows, the house rots, everything requires constant maintenance or it all goes to hell.\n\nNow, I'm fortunate to have an amazing wife, and we tackle this stuff as a team. But let me tell you, perfect is the enemy of the good when it comes to home maintenance. Some days I mow the lawn in chunks, other days I use the trimmer to get the spots I couldn't reach with the mower, and you know what? That's okay. I've even started making my bed in the morning, something small that my wife has noticed and appreciated. It feels good to accomplish these little tasks, and I've learned that doing one small thing is infinitely better than trying to be a perfectionist and getting overwhelmed by everything at once.\n\nThis whole ownership and responsibility thing applies to way more than just houses. Take Bitcoin, for instance. One of the most beautiful aspects of Bitcoin is that it's divisible into 100 million satoshis per coin. You don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin any more than you need to buy a whole apartment building to get started in real estate. You can literally buy $10 worth of Bitcoin and still experience the journey of ownership. Sure, some company came out with a product where you can buy $10 of real estate through some ETF trust, but that's an awful product because of all the fees, the fact that you don't get the benefits of actually owning and living in the place, and the hassle of setting up a brokerage account. Bitcoin is infinitely more accessible.\n\nOf course, with Bitcoin ownership comes responsibility like securing your private keys, understanding how the technology works, learning about the philosophy behind it. It's not easy, but here's the thing: doing hard stuff and having responsibility is actually a good thing. There's an immense sense of pride when you hold Bitcoin through the drawdowns, see the upside, and realize how money actually works. You start going down these fascinating rabbit holes about philosophy, monetary policy, and the nature of value itself.\n\nAnd speaking of monetary policy, let me address the elephant in the room across most Western nations right now. I vehemently disagree with socialism and communism, but I get why some people find those ideas appealing. If you're drowning in student loan debt that you took on at 18 because adults told you it was the \"smart\" thing to do, if you're watching housing prices skyrocket while your wages stagnate, if you feel completely disenfranchised by a system where politicians pretend to care about the poor while simultaneously implementing inflationary policies that hurt the poor more than anyone else...yeah, I can understand why you might think the grass is greener on the socialist side of the fence.\n\nThe Marxists do sell their vision well, I'll give them that. On paper, it sounds incredible! Everyone gets what they need, no one gets left behind, perfect equality for all. It's like a beautiful fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after. But here's the brutal truth: it's a complete fantasy that ignores human nature and the reality of scarcity. What these systems actually create is a different kind of inequality where political connections matter infinitely more than merit, where innovation dies a slow death because there's zero incentive to create anything new, and where everyone becomes equally miserable except for the small group of people at the top who somehow always manage to exempt themselves from the rules.\n\nThe politicians lie straight to your face about caring while they simultaneously print money that devalues your savings and makes everything more expensive. And here's the kicker that most people don't realize: central banking is inherently communist in its structure. Think about it. A small group of unelected bureaucrats controlling the money supply for billions of people? That's not free market capitalism, that's central planning with extra steps. This is exactly why we see so many Marxist politicians promising checks they'll never be able to cash. They know the system is rigged, they just want to be the ones doing the rigging.\n\nInstead of waiting for some government savior, I want to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves and their actions. Get some skin in the game. Learn about Bitcoin. Start small if you have to, but start. The beautiful thing about ownership, whether it's a house, Bitcoin, or even just making your bed in the morning, is that it changes how you think about the world. You stop being a victim of circumstances and start being an active participant in your own life.\n\nHere's a crucial point that ties everything together: when you're thinking about spending money, don't just think about the sticker price. Think about the maintenance costs, the ongoing responsibilities, the time and energy required. This is where the real wisdom lies. Money is absolutely fantastic and can purchase amazing things, but sometimes the most valuable purchases aren't things at all, they are experiences. Last year, I bought my dad a ticket to a comedy show for his birthday and we went together. He loved it, and honestly, it was so much more meaningful than any trinket I could have bought him. That shared experience, that time together, that laughter, that's the stuff that really matters.\n\nMore money doesn't have to mean more problems if you're reflective and smart about how you spend it. If you think through the true cost of ownership, if you choose experiences over stuff when it makes sense, if you embrace responsibility instead of running from it, then you won't get bogged down when you have more money.\n\nThe grass isn't always greener on the other side, but it's definitely worth tending to your own lawn. And who knows? You might just find that the work itself, the responsibility, the maintenance, the daily grind of ownership, is actually part of what makes life meaningful. Life's a lawn, and you're the gardener. So mow it, own it, and don't forget to take out the trash, because even Stephen A. Smith knows a messy yard is worse than a bad take.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*l3t9hjI36pehTjuHr9GGNw.png)\n\n6/25/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
