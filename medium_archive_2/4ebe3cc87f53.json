Going through a public airport is rarely anyone's idea of a good time, but traveling with kids has its unexpected perks. You get waved into the lighter x-ray scanner, you board first, and a surprising number of airline employees, especially the women, suddenly treat you like a heroic figure who woke up and chose family. All it takes is a baby to unlock premium customer service.\n\nOf course there is the flip side. More bags, more snacks, more tiny humans who can disappear behind a single rolling suitcase. Still, I feel lucky I get to fly with them. It is wild to remember that a little over a century ago almost no one had done this. The Wright brothers were still tinkering with wooden wings while military pilots were the only ones who knew what the ground looked like from above. Now I book flights by tapping a glowing rectangle in my hand, pay with Apple Pay, and put it all on a credit card I fully intend to pay off before the balance hits, because the interest on plastic is straight usury.\n\nAnyways, we are heading to Jersey to spend time with Paige's family, and I am excited for Ryder to see some snow and for all of us to get a change of scenery. I had planned to hit a comedy show this weekend, but two of my boys dropped out, so the universe has decided that laughter will have to wait. I will reschedule and pretend we are all still young enough to make plans that never change.\n\nTravel begins. Kids in tow. Spirit intact. Until tomorrow :)\n\n12/11/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
