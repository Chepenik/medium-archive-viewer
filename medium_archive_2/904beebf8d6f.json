  "content": "# Day 1361\n\nI keep circling back to this notion of a singular consciousness. A holographic universe where every tiny part contains the whole. This theme sure does seem to keep coming up in the content I consume. Maybe it's just that thing about once you plop something into your consciousness you start noticing it everywhere. Like when you play that game to find VW Beatles and next thing you know you see them everywhere. Yet, I feel it's more than that. Think about it for a second, just picture the internet, or even the ancient Silk Road threading through empires long past: humanity has always hungered to weave these vast networks, binding distant lives into a shared pulse. Sure, some animals collaborate in packs or hives, but our knack for connecting souls across oceans and epochs? That feels like our true superpower. Deep down, I hold this conviction that we are all entangled in the strange tapestry we call reality, threads of one grand design.\n\nI read a great X article today about being chronically online which relates because the internet has connected us in magical ways. It has also produced more brain rot content than one could ever consume in a lifetime.\n\n![[https://x.com/benroy/status/1999215143729742002](https://x.com/benroy/status/1999215143729742002?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*i92YWqKBt5rRbeoU-nddyA.png)\n\nIt cut straight to the bone. Here's one of the quotes that landed for me: \"When trying to make changes in my life something I've noticed is that carrots are stronger than sticks, and by that, I mean spending time on activities that I'm excited about seems to be a better counterweight to overusing the internet than trying to force arbitrary limits on myself. I think humans are more driven by incentives than deterrents, so maybe the answer for all of us is simply that we need to fall in love with real life again. That's what I want.\"\n\nThere's profound wisdom in leaning on incentives to shape our paths. The stick might whip you into compliance in the moment, delivering quick wins, but it crumbles the instant the threat fades. People obey out of fear, not fire, and the moment escape glimmers, they bolt. Long-term? It breeds resentment, not roots. The carrot, though... It dangles with genuine allure. It may unfold slower, which requires patience on behalf of the person dangling it, but it forges bonds that endure. Allies become devotees, drawn not by dread but by delight, eager to chase that shared spark again and again.\n\nThe post delivered another gem toward the end: \"I realize a lot of what I've talked about can feel overwhelming, and it's difficult sometimes to know where to start, so what I'll say as I wrap up is this doesn't have to be that deep. Stuff as simple as not having your phone in your room overnight or making sure to eat breakfast before logging on can be incredibly helpful. Small changes can have meaningful impacts.\" This is the quiet magic of compounding at work. Tiny, steadfast habits, stacked over seasons, bloom into transformations we scarcely imagined. It's the antidote to our rush for instant everything: fast gains breed slow-rotting woes, while patient builds yield enduring peace. Think of wealth, too. Quick fortunes, snatched without sweat or true service, slip like sand. But those earned through grit? They compound into legacies.\n\nThat brings me to a line from Simon Dixon that echoes in my mind from a podcast long ago: \"Money is spiritual.\" If that's true, then hoarding fiat feels like a violation of the soul. That might seem like a bold claim, but what else captures the toll of bankrolling endless cycles of war, theft, and ruin? Fiat hands a cabal the reins to alchemize destruction into \"growth,\" inflating GDP on the backs of the innocent. No wonder saving in Bitcoin lets me sleep sounder. For you, it might be gold's steady gleam, or land's rooted promise, ammo's quiet assurance, even livestock or those childhood stacks of Pokémon cards. Anything but fuel for distant explosions that shatter lives halfway around the globe.\n\nWe're woven together, all of us, in ways I struggle to name but feel in my bones. A current hums between consciousnesses, a spiritual skirmish raging just beneath the surface. Yesterday, pacing the airport concourse to rack up my daily steps, you know those small positive habits that compound, a verse from Exodus struck me while listening to the audiobook version of the Bible: Moses, bold and trembling, asks God His name, and the reply thunders back, \"I AM.\" Chills raced down my spine. I can't explain the why of it, but in that instant, I knew it, body and breath. He is the essence, the One, the eternal verb of being.\n\nGlory to the Lord, who spun this vast consciousness from nothing, stepping into the raw, radiant mess of human experience: the triumphs, the stumbles, the ache and the awe. What a staggering truth to hold, and what a fierce call to tenderness. To wound another is to carve into our own flesh; no wonder giving floods us with light, while betrayal leaves a hollow pit in our stomach. It's etched into our code, this sacred wiring, urging us toward unity because, in the end, there is no other.\n\nYes, you must look inward to fix the World, but once you have done so and seen the light you will naturally help others achieve the calling. It's a beautiful paradox if you ask me.\n\n12/12/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
