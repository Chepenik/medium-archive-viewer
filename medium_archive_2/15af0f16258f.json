For one, when you tell your two-year-old _\"Don't throw food on the floor\"_, somehow that instruction transforms into _\"Oh, I should throw even more food on the floor and laugh about it.\"_\n\nThat, my dear readers, is basically how AI works.\n\n**Weights: The Parenting Knobs**\n\nIn artificial intelligence, \"weights\" are like the knobs and dials on a stereo, but instead of adjusting bass and treble, they adjust the strength of connections between ideas.\n\nWhen I repeat to my daughter, _\"We brush our teeth before bed,\"_ that \"weight\" gets stronger over time. Eventually, she starts grabbing her toothbrush and demanding she brushes her teeth without my help. Success!\n\nBut sometimes, those weights lead to unexpected connections. Imagine me saying, _\"We brush before bed,\"_ and instead of reaching for her own toothbrush, my daughter grabs the dog's toothbrush and heads for the poor pup.\n\nThat never actually happened (don't worry, the dog's dental routine is safe). But it's the perfect example of how AI sometimes \"hallucinates.\" It's not memorizing a strict rulebook, it's making connections based on patterns. And occasionally, those patterns lead to delightfully (or not so delightfully if AI is deployed in a production environment) weird results.\n\n**Inference: The Real-Time Guesswork**\n\nNow, here's where it gets really familiar for any parent: inference.\n\nInference is just a fancy way of saying the AI is guessing in real time what should come next. Step by step, word by word, just like your toddler stringing together sentences.\n\nWhen I ask, _\"What's the capital of France?\"_ the AI checks its weights and says, \"I've seen this pattern before... the answer is probably _Paris._\"\n\nWhen I ask my daughter, _\"What do we say when someone gives us a cookie?\"_ she checks her mental weights and says, _\"More cookies please.\"_ Not technically wrong, but not the answer I was going for. So I correct her and let her know, _\"Thank you\"_ is what I was looking for.\n\nThe above is the parenting version of what researchers do with AI: they label training data or give feedback so the system learns what counts as the _right_ answer. Just like my daughter, the AI doesn't come with perfect manners, it gets better with a little guidance.\n\nSo to summarize inference, it is a real-time prediction, based on past training. Sometimes it's spot on, sometimes it's hilariously off.\n\n**Training Data: The Bedtime Stories**\n\nWhere do these weights come from? Training.\n\nThink of all the books, songs, and bedtime stories I've read to my daughter. Every story shapes her sense of the world, just like training data shapes an AI's sense of language.\n\nIf I read \"Goodnight Moon\" a hundred times, she'll eventually think every goodnight ritual needs a quiet old lady whispering hush. If I only read dinosaur books, she'll start calling bedtime \"extinction hour.\"\n\nAI is the same. Its \"training data\" is basically the sum of all the stories, articles, and conversations it absorbed. And the weights are how it remembers which parts matter most.\n\n**The Big Picture: Raising Kids, Raising AI**\n\nHere's the big lesson: teaching kids and training AI both involve guiding patterns, not handing over rulebooks.\n\n- **Training data**: The stories and lessons you pour in.\n\n- **Weights**: The invisible knobs that decide what sticks.\n\n- **Inference**: The real-time guesses that sometimes surprise you.\n\nAs parents, we know we can't script everything. Kids, like AI, remix what we teach in ways we didn't expect. Sometimes it's brilliant. Sometimes it's messy. Most of the time, it's both.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAI is like fatherhood: you pour in stories, lessons, and examples (training data), the child develops \"weights\" (connections that get stronger over time), and then they respond in real time (inference). And just like kids, sometimes the answers are perfect... and sometimes you just have to laugh. If you want to learn something ask AI to apply it to your own situation and you will be pleasantly suprised by how powerful and insightful it can be. It just needs the write prompting in the same way kids just need the right parenting. Luckily for the latter, genuine love and care is all you need. AI is a little more complicated to get right... or is it?\n\n9/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
