  "content": "# Day 1324\n\nGot a workout in today and decided to do some bench press. Have not benched in awhile and got 225 pounds for 10 reps. YUGE.\n\nSometimes staring at screens makes me want to go insane. So whenever I (or you anon) feel like that, the best solution is to get some exercise. That can be playing sports with your boys, walking, going for a bike ride, you name it. Get outside, enjoy nature, and realize that while screens are valuable, real life is 1000x better.\n\nUntil tomorrow :)\n\n11/5/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
