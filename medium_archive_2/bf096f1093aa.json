  "content": "# Day 1285\n\nI saw a post today about how happiness comes from subtracting. To paraphrase the idea it is that adding stuff to your life increases the junk you have to worry about and eliminating that allows you to remove the things keeping you unhappy. Powerful. Haven't been able to get that out of my mind.\n\nI've been a good consumeeeeer lately. Got a new iPhone, I love going to Walmart and buying stuff I want, but don't really need. Like extra bags of epsom salt hahahaha. Jokes aside, I think the point is true. Sounds like it's time for a purge. I've got so many shoes, shirts, shorts, and jackets I don't wear anymore. I should really get rid of them. Doing so will free up so much space and make me feel better about not having so much clutter.\n\nCleaning up my office the other day felt so good. When I woke to start work it was a breath of fresh air compared to rolling into a messy office. So today I'm going to keep this Medium short, in the spirit of less is more.\n\n9/27/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
