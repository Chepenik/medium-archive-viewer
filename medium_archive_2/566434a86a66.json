  "content": "# Day 1267\n\nDo hard things because they are worth doing. Simple as that. You will feel better about yourself after. Tonight I wrapped up my second half marathon. I'm exhausted. My legs are cooked. But underneath that fatigue is a real sense of accomplishment.\n\nThere's something powerful about choosing pain on purpose. When you pick the challenge, you stop being a victim of circumstance and start proving to yourself what you're made of. Every hard thing completed is a receipt of capability you can pull out later when life throws you something tougher. And life is hard so rest assured plenty of challenges await.\n\nThe key though, in my humble opinion, is picking _your_ hard thing. The one you're willing to show up for. If you can find that and learn to fall in love with the suck, I guarantee you'll look back on your life with joy.\n\n![It pays to have a good sense of humor as well](https://miro.medium.com/1*JDXVLNFbygcHFF6PIgF4LA.png)\n\nNobody brags about watching TV and eating ice cream all day. Unless they're a film critic. Then maybe they do, lol. But personally it is not what I want to brag about when I tell my grandchildren all the hard stuff I did.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*qEbryqGdXucfE_7xuu3vOQ.png)\n\n9/9/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
