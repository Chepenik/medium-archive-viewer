  "content": "# Day 1362\n\nDid a Podcast today with [Marks](https://x.com/marksuman). Man it feels good to rip with smart people. My podcast doesn't have a big following, but it's still fun to get the chance to chat with others who I would not have the opportunity to do so.\n\nI also went ahead and got my usual Jersey run in too: 2.5 miles straight up the mountain, back down, then looping around to do the climb again. It was cold and when I woke up and I wasn't sure if I would get a run in, but I'm glad I did. After that, Whole Foods with the family and then a dinner of salmon, broccoli, and mac & cheese.\n\nLater in the evening I had a drink with my in-laws and showed them how to make AI songs. Watching them get genuinely blown away was its own kind of joy. It is pretty cool to make personalized songs that are actually really good.\n\nGrateful I get to come up here and spend time with my family. God is good. :)\n\n12/13/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
