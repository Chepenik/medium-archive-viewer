  "content": "# Day 1309\n\nSo there has been a bunch of debate about OP_RETURN and increasing the size. I get people are pissed about it, but it's kind of amazing that you can pay a small amount of money to get something stuck in the chain for as long as Bitcoin exists. I am still unsure where I fall in the debate, but I did take the chance to put my family's name in an OP_RETURN. Also, I'm pretty confident that Bitcoin will continue to survive and thrive regardless of what happens with OP_RETURN.\n\n![[https://x.com/OP_RETURN_Bot/status/1980812139485974599](https://x.com/OP_RETURN_Bot/status/1980812139485974599)](https://miro.medium.com/1*5hxnil4UpErF29UUjTUziQ.png)\n\n![[https://mempool.space/tx/bbbce847e1eb532f2b61ad0f734ca6463d66e1c0c440c41e616d9a389fd01b69](https://mempool.space/tx/bbbce847e1eb532f2b61ad0f734ca6463d66e1c0c440c41e616d9a389fd01b69)](https://miro.medium.com/1*4-eBUNDT53UUyMT7N4MoBw.png)\n\nIt's officially in a block last I checked. Excited to meet my son Ryder soon :D\n\n10/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
