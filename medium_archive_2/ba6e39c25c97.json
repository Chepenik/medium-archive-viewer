  "content": "# Day 1266\n\nYou'll have to excuse me, my dear reader, but tonight my brain is ready for sleep. So this one will be short.\n\nIt was a long day at work, but a good one, as it always is working in Bitcoin. Sometimes though it feels a bit jarring returning to the grind after a long vacation. After work I made dinner, mowed the lawn, read a chapter of [The Soul After Death](https://amzn.to/4m7Nw6y), adjusted my new [casio watch](https://amzn.to/4gjfMlp), and finished writing my guest article for Bitcoin News on the CNN Fear & Greed Index.\n\nI do feel like I did well, or as the young jits of the world would say \"I cooked\", on that article. But it's just under 2k words of TL;DR STACK SATS STAY HUMBLE, YOU ARE NOT A PROFESSIONAL TRADER, SO GET LONG BITCOIN AND LEARN TO CHILL.\n\nAdvice I wish someone gave me when I first came upon Bitcoin in 2017. But to be fair we must learn from pain, that is only human. If we don't learn from our pain we will make mistakes in the future which are painful. Thus, every sat I sold, every missed opportunity, every regret I might look back upon and wish it had not happened was really me purchasing prudence so I can lead a better life based on the wisdom I've gained from my setbacks.\n\nI will leave you with this photo that has been AI altered so I'm wearing my new casio watch in it:\n\n![Not Nano Banana's best edit, but it will only get better from here as AI gets exponentially more useful](https://miro.medium.com/1*Yr6fp-OnYGJJ2PU-_R4y7A.png)\n\n9/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
