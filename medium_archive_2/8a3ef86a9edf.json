  "content": "# Day 1297\n\nReleased an interview today:\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1976399144643330219](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1976399144643330219)](https://miro.medium.com/1*TN9ojutHMW904o5H8qzDSg.png)\n\nIt feels good to release a podcast after not doing so for a long time. Usually I don't release my Bitcoinnews interviews, but this one the interviewee asked me to do so and I gladly obliged.\n\n10/9/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
