  "content": "# Day 1355\n\nWas feeling a bit down so I went for a walk. Fixed it!\n\nIt's so simple yet we love to overcomplicate things. I'm just as guilty as anyone else of doing this. Yet, all it took was a few miles outside of pushing my son in a stroller and like that all the sadness left my body.\n\nDon't overcomplicate it anon.\n\n12/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
