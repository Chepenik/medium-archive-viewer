  "content": "# Day 1236\n\nIt's important to have some quiet time. To just be alone with your thoughts. Talk to God, talk to yourself, enjoy the peace. It seems so simple, but it's easy to overlook. I know I am guilty of it.\n\nSometimes I go to the grocery store, look at the price of things, and think to myself yea we're living through Weimar Germany, part two. Except this time it's happening globally and many Americans are not prepared because they haven't lived through hyperinflation before.\n\nI know a guy from Venezuela who told me they look at banks like the world cup... meaning you always need a new one every four years. Pretty funny and also pretty sad.\n\nJokes aside, I keep thinking about Jack Dorsey's tweet from 2021:\n\n![[https://x.com/jack/status/1451733913961783299](https://x.com/jack/status/1451733913961783299)](https://miro.medium.com/1*TaHSIpOYBNddEYUqaVttqQ.png)\n\nI've been privileged to live in the United States, where it's not as dire as in some other places, but it's still profoundly sad. Fiat money robs from everyone, but especially from those without assets. It's an awful system and Bitcoin gives me hope we can fix it. We should not have to work for a money another man can print. Full stop!\n\nMen who can print won't give up the power easily so do yourself a favor and STUDY Bitcoin.\n\n8/9/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
