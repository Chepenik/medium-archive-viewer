  "content": "# Day 1359\n\nCaught up with a college buddy today. It's wild how you can go from seeing someone every day to barely crossing paths for years. Technology makes it easy to hop on a video call from different continents, yet the calls always remind me how quickly life moves.\n\nMy kids make that passage of time even clearer. It feels like yesterday my oldest was wobbling through her first steps. Now she's twice the size, sprinting around the house and sneaking ice cream in the middle of the day if I'm not paying attention.\n\nMoments that once felt endless turn out to be brief. You look away for a second, and the people you love have grown, moved, changed. Today's call just made me want to hold the present a little closer.\n\nAlso makes me appreciative of this time before Ryder grows up and gets mischievous around 2 years old😂\n\n![Lil Sloaner](https://miro.medium.com/1*MYKMsCektnOkOGVq-RFD-w.png)\n\n12/10/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
