My toddler treats a clean living room the way that boulder treated Sisyphus... except my boulder throws Goldfish crumbs and demands snacks every four minutes. And Ryder? The baby? He's growing at such an insane rate I'm convinced he'll be asking for the car keys by 2026.\n\nStill I would not have it any other way. One day the messes will stop, the toys won't be everywhere, and they won't be this tiny. I know I'll look back on these chaos-filled days with nothing but love. Funny how quickly life goes on. Feels like yesterday I was being driven to elementary school thinking about my lunch time snack. Now I'm raising my own children, excited to homeschool them over the coming years.\n\nAs they say in the Lion King, Sloan's favorite movie btw, 'It's the circle of life, and it moves us all...'\n\n11/19/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
