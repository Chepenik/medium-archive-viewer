  "content": "# Day 1320\n\nYou know I think one of the greatest things about obtaining wealth is that it allows you to slow down. As the saying goes \"Time is money\". Wealth lets you work on things you love. It enables you to build for your own joy rather than for prioritizing profits over all else. Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to turn a profit. Where it gets bad is when you prioritize profits over people. When you stuff your food full of high fructose corn syrup and seed oils instead of real sugar and butter because you can increase your bottom line. When you are willing to dump waste into a river rather than dispose of it properly because it's much cheaper to ruin the environment than be a good steward of it. In the short term at least. Long term it's way costlier, but I digress.\n\nIn many ways, I believe fiat is to blame for these problems. Causing people, and as a result corporations (which are made of people) to take shortcuts. Hard to plan for the long term when you must obsess over the short term.\n\nThe solution? A magic internet money with a fixed supply that allows you to send value in a permissionless manner. A coin that is being mentioned by the sitting Treasury Secretary of The Unites States Of America.\n\n![[https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1984378179809599619](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1984378179809599619)](https://miro.medium.com/1*MFQbuOPdTQ6dflWiv_rr3Q.png)\n\nHoly smokes, felliow Bitcoiners. On White Paper Day yesterday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent bulled poaaaaaasted about Bitcoin. How far we have come in ~17 years.\n\nOf course the jab at Democrats might be the hook that got him trending, but let's not kid ourselves. This is huge. The guy steering America's financial ship just publicly praised Bitcoin's unbreakable uptime and anti-fragility.\n\nThis feels like a mic-drop moment for Satoshi's vision. Don't get me wrong: Fiat currency is still the villain here since it is immoral, inflationary theft disguised as \"policy.\" It's a rigged game designed to debase your savings while the Cantillonaires print their way to prosperity. The \"rules\" are written by the same fiat overlords who got us into this mess.\n\nThat said, I'm not popping champagne for Bessent just yet. He's still a Wall Street hound at heart, the kind who'll prioritize propping up the dollar over the average American's wallet. Loyalty to the greenback runs deep in those Treasury halls. But actions speak louder than skepticism, and this tweet? It's a crack in the dam of the debt based ponzi scheme we all live under.\n\n\"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\" Bitcoin's journey maps perfectly: ignored as a cypherpunk toy, laughed off as tulip mania 2.0, fought tooth-and-nail with various bans and FUD... and now? The U.S. Treasury is nodding along. If this isn't the white flag of adoption waving, then I don't know what is!\n\nWake up, my dear reader. Fiat isn't just flawed; it's programmed to fail. Inflation will keep scorching your purchasing power, \"free stuff\" handouts will pile on the debt, and the consequences will hit hardest for those not paying attention (i.e holding assets to protect themselves). That's why I grind on Bitcoin via my side hustle, full-time gig, and every spare minute I have in between. Bitcoin has done so much good for my life and I hope to help others see why.\n\nBut the truth is I can't save everyone. Only you can save yourself. That is the real power move. If you're reading this, and are one of the lucky anon souls who stumbled here, please consider doing this one thing: Study Bitcoin. Deeply. Your financial future, hell, your sovereignty, might ride on it.\n\nMark my words: That orange coin hits $1 million in about five years, give or take a year. With the Treasury Secretary himself singing its praises, how could anyone bet on zero? Nah, we're adding zeros. Big ones.\n\nSome say the next zero is the best zero, believe me, it's tremendous. Adding a zero to the USD price? It looks so good, folks, so beautiful. When you're stacking the coin they can't debase against the one they can, it's simple math, really, the greatest math you've ever seen. Don't mess this up. Your grandchildren's grandchildren are depending on you! Generational wealth is obtainable as Bitcoin monetizes itself for the first time. But it's not going to happen twice. Clock is tic-tocing, next block.\n\n![Love Or Hate The Man I Am Grateful We Finally Have A President Embracing Bitcoin (Along With The Treasury Secretary)](https://miro.medium.com/1*_jdWKQizh9tU6axPjYjGHg.png)\n\n11/1/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
