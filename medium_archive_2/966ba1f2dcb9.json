  "content": "# Day 1347\n\n![The Hole I Birded Today 11/28/25](https://miro.medium.com/1*07e5GCMbpZ-e7R_cHZM2Zw.png)\n\nPlayed in the Thanksgiving golf tournament this morning and had a blast. We actually tied for the best score, then lost the tiebreaker, a sudden-death chip-off on the practice green, because a group was coming up behind us. Losing in the chip off made me replay a bunch of tiny moments in my head. If we just sunk that one putt. If we just cleaned up that one approach. The classic golfer spiral.\n\nStill, it was a genuinely great round. I even grabbed a real birdie, pure tee shot & clean putt, on a tough par 3. We play best ball for the Hillegas Thanksgiving round, and we carded a +3 in cold, windy conditions. Respectable.\n\nThe lesson hit me afterward while writing this. We had no idea what score would win. I assumed it would take something under par, but the weather changed everything. +3 actually tied for first. +2 would've skipped the chip-off entirely. It made me think: how many things in life are exactly like that? You don't know what outcome you're aiming against, so you ease off slightly, or you assume you're already out of the running, and that tiny bit of hesitation ends up costing you.\n\nGolf mirrors life's margins. One extra moment of focus, one extra rep, one extra breath of effort can be the difference between almost and actually.\n\nToday didn't go our way, but it was fun. And now I'm more excited than ever for next year. I haven't won one of these tournaments since I was a kid, and I'd like to win one before I turn 30.\n\nSo next year it is >:)\n\n11/28/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
