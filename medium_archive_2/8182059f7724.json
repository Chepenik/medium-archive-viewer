Sometimes that curtain is a veil of language, sometimes it's geography, and sometimes it's knowledge itself. For centuries, power has been tied to who gets to see behind the curtain, scribes copying texts, priests guarding Latin, politicians navigating legal jargon, etc.\n\nToday, that curtain is being ripped open again. And this time, it's not the printing press. It's super powerful statistics, also known as AI.\n\n**The Strange Logic of History**\n\nHistory has a habit of hiding its biggest surprises in the smallest accidents.\n\nToday I learned that storm shipwrecks, courtesy of Admiral Shovel in 1707, spurred Britain to fund longitude research, which inspires a clockmaker to design a chronometer, which improves steel, which fuels cannon design, which inspires Napoleon's artillery, which sponsors innovation contests, which unlocks food preservation, which spreads industrial papermaking, which eventually gives us... toilet paper. Shout out to [ReadMultiplex](https://readmultiplex.com/2025/03/03/complex-information-was-a-form-of-encryption-with-ai-in-the-hands-of-millions-it-is-no-longer/) for educating me of this. I do recommend buying a subscription.\n\nOne mistake on the high seas. One cascade. Entirely new worlds.\n\nThe lesson from this incredible story? Innovation is never linear. Progress comes less from prediction and more from connection, threads weaving together from places no one expected.\n\n**From Scarcity to Abunda**nce\n\nFor most of history, information was locked away. Scarcity gave rise to intermediaries: the blacksmith, the banker, the professor, the politician. You couldn't act without them.\n\nBut AI changes the terms. We no longer live in a world where knowledge trickles down from gatekeepers. The reasoning power of machines, once hidden in universities or governments, is now in the hands of millions.\n\nThis is why old systems creak. Representative democracy was designed when horses carried ballots. Universities were built when books were rare and professors were living encyclopedias. Corporations structured themselves like armies because coordination was hard without telegraphs or phones.\n\nBut what happens when anyone can access the playbook directly, instantly, globally? The curtain collapses. It's a bit like this scene in The Wizard of Oz:\n\n![\"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\"](https://miro.medium.com/0*vOZCDh4v-gwWVEqs.jpg)\n\n**Why the Future Feels Chaotic**\n\nWhenever a curtain is lifted, panic sets in.\n\nWhen Gutenberg spread literacy, elites worried that reading would rot people's minds. Today we have Tiktok for that. When Mozart composed symphonies, critics dismissed it as noise. When calculators hit schools, people warned that students' brains would turn to mush. Instead we got to use our math buddies to write 80085 (BOOBS).\n\nWe're in that moment again. AI makes reasoning scalable. And suddenly, everyone, not just scholars or specialists, can play with ideas, generate solutions, or remix knowledge.\n\nIt looks chaotic because enfranchisement always looks chaotic. Democracy looks messy compared to monarchy. Markets look messy compared to central plans. TikTok looks messy compared to Latin. But the mess is the price of empowerment.\n\n**How to Thrive in the New Era**\n\nIf AI is our printing press moment, then here's how I think one can try to prepare themself:\n\n**1. Build Direct Access**\n\nStop relying on gatekeepers. Just as the press made scribes obsolete, AI makes certain \"knowledge brokers\" obsolete. Learn to use these tools yourself, not as toys, but as collaborators. Empower yourself. No one else is going to do it for you, but AI will make it a lot easier.\n\n**2. Think Across Boundaries**\n\nThe Admiral Shovel story isn't about ships or clocks or cannons, it's about connections. In an AI-accelerated world, breakthroughs will come from cross-pollination. Be curious across disciplines, not just deep in one silo. Don't be afraid to frolic, to go for a walk, to just sit idle with your thoughts for a little bit.\n\n**3. Embrace Institutional Collapse**\n\nOld structures weren't built for this speed. Rather than resisting the crumbling, prepare to thrive in systems that are direct, transparent, and personalized. Especially in regards to your money. USD will be hyperinflated away. Only keep as much fiat as you are willing to lose. Not financial advice, but some solid advice is study Bitcoin.\n\n**4. Get Comfortable With Iteration**\n\nBy the time you master one AI tool, another will replace it. Don't cling. Flow. Adaptability, not static expertise, is the edge. I find this to be true as I'm both excited and exhausted by all the new AI tools coming out everyday.\n\n**5. Spot the Curtains in Your Field**\n\nEvery profession hides behind complexity. Lawyers have jargon. Doctors have diagnostics. Coders have cryptic stacks. Ask: what's the \"Latin\" of my industry? That's what AI will democratize next. Lean into the unkown because AI is about to make it a lot more known.\n\n**6. Strengthen Human Uniqueness**\n\nAI will reason, but it won't replace the soul's ability for judgment, creativity, or love. Lean into what machines can't replicate: empathy, imagination, and ethical decision-making.\n\n**The Road Ahead**\n\nIt's tempting to see the rise of AI as overwhelming, even destabilizing. And in many ways, it is. Institutions will stumble. Old authorities will resist. Critics will sneer that the \"masses\" aren't ready.\n\nBut history is clear: every time the curtain is pulled back, society eventually expands. More voices, more participation, more possibility.\n\nThe future won't be clean. It'll be messy, turbulent, and surprising. But it will also be the greatest opening of knowledge humanity has ever seen.\n\nAnd the real question is: when the curtain lifts, will you shrink back, or step through?\n\nFor your children's sake I hope it is the latter!\n\n8/29/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
