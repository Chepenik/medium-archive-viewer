Consider the ingenious hackers who conjured an \"exclusive steakhouse\" on a whim, delivering an exceptional experience to delighted patrons. Their creative spirit and pluck are inspirations.\n\n![[https://x.com/mehran__jalali/status/1706768795627409855](https://x.com/mehran__jalali/status/1706768795627409855?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*QGZI-uPzxOpBIIMiVD2Q-g.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Tqwja2WcoGiXy30RF0pqrA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*0MpLs_9FmfxTWR6Tc5_TaQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*U38_LTzuO9Npjt645vaCxQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*RcnlahgTaQ5-si4sy1jnhQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*XTub5kV-IPnh8i6l-KD1zA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*4xQsqGzrYE_pIWWU96wjfQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*1xd-RDtKmX9z1duydz151g.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*PdvwZaz9Ts8T3TbDcNSqng.png)\n\nThough the hackers' methods may have bent laws, their harmless mischief let humanity shine. Like their ephemeral restaurant, a one-of-a-kind collusion of joy, we too can create fleeting beauty when we subvert rigid rules.\n\nSuch audacious stories are uplifting sparks, rekindling my faith in humanity. It's easy to fixate on troubles, yet grandeur dwells within us all. We need not be passive fate's victims because we can author our own transformations. When hardship is embraced consciously and aligned with high ideals, it ceases to be a curse and becomes instead a pathway to wisdom.\n\nStay hungry! The world needs more spirited bunking of the status quo. You see, the human story, it's an epic, an epic in the making. And guess what? You, me, all of us, we're the authors. We each got a verse to add to this grand tale of human achievement.\n\nNow especially, as the internet lets us chronicle our journey. With technologies like Bitcoin, Nostr and AI, we can build a better future. One where each of us has a chance to create value out of thin air by exerting our will creatively. I'm excited to help show how these tools can improve life when guided by imagination. The future is our blank canvas, and our minds the brushes. Let us paint some good shit, like a 1/1 Steakhouse experience in East Village.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*vDfO-hn79rztFVMI)\n\n9/26/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
