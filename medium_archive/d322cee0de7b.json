  "content": "# Day 941\n\nToday was incredible - I got to explore Santa Monica, California, and enjoy lunch with some amazing coworkers from Swan. California truly is something else.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*w5YZbuxh8CF_8KLLFAeUPA.png)\n\nThe Santa Monica pier was stunning. So many cool things to do and places to see. The weather is fantastic. The food is expensive as hell, but absolutely delicious. An obese woman was taking a shower, butt ass naked, in the public shower outside near the Santa Monica pier. Feels like a dream out here. California dreaming.\n\nI'm really grateful to be here and soak in this experience. Tonight, I'm heading to the Laugh Factory, and I can't wait for it. Comedy, good company, and California vibes - it doesn't get much better :)\n\nI do miss my ladies though. Can't wait to see them when I get back home on Sunday!\n\n10/18/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
