Phones have become the adult pacifier. Feeling awkward? Just stare at the piece of glass in your pocket. Feel like you've got nothing to do? Why not chase a little hit of cheap dopamine?\n\nThere's always an excuse to check our devices, and if one doesn't exist, we invent one. This isn't healthy. Being bored is not a problem to solve; it's a skill to practice. Learn to sit with it. Disconnect. Let your mind wander.\n\nIt might not seem like much until you try it and realize just how addicted to dopamine you've become. Small changes can make a big difference over the course of a lifetime.\n\n11/29/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
