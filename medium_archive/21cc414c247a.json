  "content": "# Day 1002\n\nIt's a fun hypothetical to think about what would make perfect money.\n\nMoney is basically a ledger and I think most would agree we want the ledger to be fair, honest, permissionless, uncensorable, and transparent.\n\nA small group should not be able to edit the ledger by decree.\n\nFrom a first principles standpoint, it's illogical for some to have the exclusive privilege to print currency.\n\nYet, this is the system many of us, myself included, use as our unit of account.\n\nTo be fair, almost all of my bills and expenses are both measured in and paid with dollars.\n\nI genuinely believe that when measured in fiat currency, life will continue to become more expensive, while measured in Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly affordable.\n\nThat's why I'm making an effort to think more in terms of Bitcoin as my unit of account rather than relying solely on fiat.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*rA8GDUVHpvlBcOYK)\n\n12/18/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
