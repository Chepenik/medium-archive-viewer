The broader crypto space, is a chaotic mess. Riddled with scams and speculative gambling. My CEO coined this the 'scambling era,' which sums it up perfectly. On the brighter side, stablecoins are delivering some genuinely innovative use cases, making it more seamless to move dollars digitally, 24/7/365. Oh, and I stumbled across a great header on Twitter today that I'm loving.\n\n![[https://x.com/teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex)](https://miro.medium.com/0*9xMRAzttuzZ5JI5E)\n\nOur most scarce asset is time. So use it wisely doing things you want. Regardless of the future outcome that awaits an AI-hyper-enhanced-human.\n\n2/22/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
