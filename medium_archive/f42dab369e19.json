  "content": "# Day 794\n\nThere is a powerful story in the Bible about people wanting to stone a prostitute, and Jesus says, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\" This serves as a profound reminder that it is so easy to judge others, yet we are all flawed individuals. It's challenging to refrain from judgment, but since we can never truly walk in someone else's shoes, we should strive not to judge.\n\nJudging others feels almost natural, calling out their flaws while often ignoring our own. However, true self-reflection is a rare and valuable skill. Many of us see ourselves as better looking, smarter, funnier, and kinder than we really are. Some degree of ego is necessary for achievement, but too much can lead to disaster.\n\nHere is a great example of something that reminds me to stay humble. Being reminded that not all other countries act how the propagandists in the legacy media portray them. Life is full of nuance. Remember that next time you think you are right about something because the TV, a social media feed, or a friend said so. (This message is just as much for me as it is for anyone who might ever read this)\n\n![[https://x.com/CensoredMen/status/1794181823020593619](https://x.com/CensoredMen/status/1794181823020593619)](https://miro.medium.com/1*89bRPnpM50S0mR2KvbtwQA.png)\n\nAs I grow older, I hope to maintain my curiosity, my kindness, and judge other people less. This doesn't mean I have to approve or agree with everyone, but judgment is not the path to a fulfilling life. There is much to learn from Jesus's wisdom: Christ is king!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*kmT5G-O1Zcic3GkNLSvhyA.png)\n\n5/24/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
