  "content": "# Day 776\n\nI can't lie the number 776 looks so clean. So does 1776, the year America became America.\n\n![This sh** looks so clean](https://miro.medium.com/0*jQ_jDvHLI86ojIZs.jpg)\n\nJust for that reason I'll have to write for another thousand days in a row. Honing the skills getting better everyday. Good.\n\n**Be Grateful For What You've Learned And Use That To Teach Others.** So far in 26ish years of life I have learned that liberty ain't free, life is messy, and states rights are based and so is Bitcoin.\n\n![[https://bitcoincartoons.store/collections/coloring-pages](https://bitcoincartoons.store/collections/coloring-pages)](https://miro.medium.com/1*X4MScNUlWHh8yHnmfE3l5w.png)\n\n**Understanding What A Bitcoin Order Book Is**\n\nA Bitcoin order book is a ledger that records buy and sell orders at various price levels, providing transparency and liquidity to arguably the world's freest market: Bitcoin. While centralized exchanges currently serve as necessary intermediaries to facilitate order book transactions, they inherently function as middlemen, introducing counterparty risks and fees into the equation.\n\n**The Promise of Peer-to-Peer Transactions**\n\nThe true potential of Bitcoin lies in its ability to enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Just like physical cash in the real world, direct digital value exchange can reduce costs, promote competition, and drive innovation by allowing entrepreneurs to price goods closer to marginal production costs. Despite what some Keynesians might tell you deflation is good and no people won't starve hoarding money.\n\n**Decentralized Protocols: Fostering Micro-Economies and Value Creation**\n\nEmerging decentralized protocols like Nostr and the Lightning Network are catalyzing a paradigm shift towards micro-economies built on direct value exchange. Features like \"zapping\" bitcoin directly to others' lightning wallets enable micropayments for high-quality content and services, incentivizing value creation and challenging the traditional advertising-driven model. These protocols empower individuals to seamlessly transact value across borders and communities, facilitating frictionless economic interactions that were previously impeded by intermediaries and geographic boundaries. Whether splitting bills with friends from different countries or compensating a content creator on the other side of the globe, these decentralized micro-economies unlock new realms of economic cooperation and value creation.\n\n**A Meritocratic Digital Landscape**\n\nThe possibilities for these micro-economies is endless. All kind of builders, innovators, and creators will become the driving force, fostering a meritocratic system where quality and authenticity are rewarded. This empowers individuals, cultivates high-quality communities, and enables new business models and revenue streams beyond traditional rent-seeking.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1787508781288403204](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1787508781288403204)](https://miro.medium.com/1*Mgrm6vZZ0dizjKQoFhrBBg.png)\n\nEveryone desires the form of savings that's widely adopted by others. While likes and clicks have their appeal, they can't put food on the table. The true measure of worth lies in value, not mere digital affirmations. It's crucial to remember that if something is free, you're likely the product being sold. To truly benefit from your online activities, prioritize protocols over platforms, allowing you to create value rather than becoming a mere data point to be exploited.\n\n**The Future of Value Creation and Distribution**\n\nWhile governments may not relinquish fiat currencies soon, the democratization of the internet through decentralized micro-economies promotes freedom of expression, individual sovereignty, and incentivizes the creation of more value over time. As these technologies evolve, we may witness a paradigm shift in how value is created, distributed, and appreciated online, shaping a more equitable, abundant, and vibrant digital future.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBitcoin exchanges are important and amazing for allowing people to buy and sell bitcoin, acting as on and off ramps to fiat currency. However, they can also be captured or censored. This is why individuals should use exchanges to gain custody of their bitcoin, and then flex their God given right to manage the tools they possess according to their discretion.\n\nWhen someone holds the private keys to their bitcoin they are exercising true sovereignty. An ETF, while providing exposure to bitcoin's price movements, represents a cucked version of Bitcoin. An ETF is suitable for those focused solely on number-go-up, but lacking the empowering properties of true self-custody and sovereignty that make bitcoin truly revolutionary if you self-custody. You can have the power. Bitcoin is not for everyone, but it is for anybody that wants to use it. All you have to do is provide others value.\n\n> [**Leave a tip for**](https://getalby.com/p/chep)\n\n5/6/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
