I can't imagine enduring the hardships he faced: losing both his parents by the time he was a freshman in college, losing 60% of his workforce on 9/11, and yet figuring it all out to become a success story after all that. Respect.\n\nLife is hard, and there are many battles - physical, spiritual, financial - that we must fight. However, those who confront these challenges and emerge stronger often do amazing things with their lives. This was an amazing episode, and I hope to apply the wisdom from this podcast to become a stronger, better, and more loving person.\n\nSometimes I think I know hardship, but not like that. There's always someone fighting a tougher battle, albeit a very different one. It gives me a lot of hope for this world to see someone take such a difficult situation and turn it around into an even more amazing one.\n\n10/29/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
