  "content": "Day 715\n\nI don't have much to report tonight so I'll just list the things I'm grateful for\n\n- God\n\n- My Family\n\n- My health\n\n- The ability to live where my Parents are so they can watch my child\n\n- My job\n\n- Bitcoin\n\n- Friends\n\n- That I've successfully read a chapter every single day so far this year, reading is based\n\n- Steak for lunch the past two days\n\nThere's been some wild stuff on Twitter/X the past few days. While I fully believe there is a battle of good and evil going on, it's important to stay grounded. Don't not sweat the small stuff.\n\nAsk God for courage and have faith. Darkness wins when you're scared. Fiat luz.\n\n3/6/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
