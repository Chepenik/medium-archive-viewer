  "content": "# Day 567\n\n**A Declaration for the Mass Adoption of Sovereign Individuals**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis Constitution lays the groundwork for safeguarding individual freedom and local autonomy for those aspiring to sovereignty. Aware that fiat decrees alone can't deter centralization, we concentrate on incentive alignment to counteract corruption. Crafted for those who seek a world led by just rules, not rulers, this document aims to enshrine the enduring values of independence and self-determination for all.\n\n**Preamble**\n\nWe, the people of Earth, assert that all individuals inherently possess rights to self-determination, peace, freedom, justice, entrepreneurship, and prosperity. To preserve these values, we establish this Constitution of Consent. Through aligned incentives and judicious technology use, we aim to prevent monopolies on violence and ensure enduring liberty. We urge individuals to claim their sovereignty and governments to respect it, fostering a more abundant, peaceful, and just society.\n\n**Article I: Fundamental Rights and the Framework for a Sovereign Society**\n\nAcknowledging that no constitution is perfect but serves as a vital framework for a better society, this document builds upon the seminal writings of the Magna Carta, the U.S. Constitution, and other liberty-granting documents. It aims to provide a baseline for human society to thrive in a future where technology and AI are increasingly autonomous.\n\nInherent Rights\n\nAll individuals are endowed with inherent and inalienable rights, including life, liberty, private property, privacy, and the pursuit of their own self-interest. These rights are sacrosanct and serve as the cornerstone of a free society, protected from encroachment by any entity - government or otherwise. Coupled with these liberties is the profound responsibility to respect others' private property and refrain from violation without explicit consent.\n\nGovernment's Role\n\nThe government's primary duty is to safeguard individual rights, intervening only to prevent clear and immediate harm to others. Such intervention must prioritize peaceful resolutions over vengeance and retribution. Leaders must exhaust all nonviolent options before resorting to force, applying restraint and minimizing harm when needed.\n\nEquality and Freedom\n\nEvery individual, irrespective of race, gender, or any other attribute, shall be treated equally by the government in all public matters. Discrimination is strictly prohibited. Individuals also have the right to associate freely in private matters, retaining their autonomy while public institutions uphold principles of fairness and non-discrimination.\n\nFreedom of Expression\n\nThe freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and petition are essential for the free exchange of ideas, the pursuit of knowledge, and peaceful dissent. These ensure that every citizen has a voice and a platform for their beliefs.\n\nVision for a Sovereign Society in an Era of Disruption\n\nThis Constitution is not a set of decrees but a vision for empowering people who wish to live freely, guided by their own values and unencumbered by arbitrary authority. We recognize that forthcoming technological breakthroughs have the potential to disrupt the traditional frameworks of nation-states in ways unanticipated and revolutionary.\n\nWhile nation-states may not willingly relinquish their monopolies on violence, the choice may no longer be theirs to make. Advancements similar to how Uber and Lyft disrupted the taxi monopoly could likewise erode the nation-state's monopoly on violence, compelling society to grapple with new paradigms.\n\nThis Constitution is designed as a framework to navigate this unprecedented transformation. It aims to empower every individual on Earth to build a life abundant in purpose and meaning irrespective of the shifting structures of traditional governance.\n\nBy laying down these principles, we not only prepare for imminent changes but also offer a path for individual sovereignty to flourish. To realize this vision, we embrace technology as an instrument of emancipation rather than a mechanism for subjugation.\n\n**Article II: Limited, Decentralized, and Consensual Government**\n\nVision for Governance\n\nGovernment power within this framework is a finely-calibrated tool, designed to serve the best interests of the people. It shall be wielded with restraint, guided by the principle of limiting authority to the essentials for safeguarding individual rights and societal well-being.\n\nDuty and Limitation of Government\n\nThe foremost duty of government under this constitution is to secure and defend inherent individual rights, including life, liberty, private property, privacy, and the pursuit of self-interest. Government action is justifiable only when required to prevent harm or violation of these inalienable rights, ensuring minimal influence over sovereign individuals.\n\nRule of Law\n\nThis constitution forbids the creation of laws that confer special privileges or exemptions upon any entity. The rule of law is the great equalizer, applied without exception or favoritism, ensuring impartial justice based on the merits of each case.\n\nTransparency and Accountability\n\nTransparency and accountability are the bedrock of our limited governance. Every government action, decision, and financial transaction must be openly accessible to the public, empowering citizens to hold their government accountable.\n\nRole of the Informed Citizenry\n\nAn informed populace is indispensable for upholding limited government principles. Citizens are empowered to fulfill their civic duties and participate actively in governance, unhampered by secrecy or misinformation.\n\nTaxation and Local Legislation\n\n- Optional Taxation: Taxes are optional but must be paid to vote and present laws.\n\n- Limited Taxation: A 1% sales tax on businesses and a 1% property tax based on the value of ones property when they purchased it are imposed.\n\n- Local Legislation: Those consenting to pay taxes can propose laws, requiring unanimous approval from other property taxpayers in their jurisdiction.\n\n- Bitcoin Payment: The government prefers taxes in bitcoin, positioning itself robustly for financial responsibilities. Exceptions for paying in bitcoin will be made but promptly converted into bitcoin.\n\nFormation of Jurisdictions\n\nJurisdictions can be initiated when 100% of individuals in a designated area agree to form one. Elections are held to appoint a representative to the Global High Court, reflecting the community's commitment to just and impartial global governance.\n\nFluid Jurisdictions\n\nIf a group is keen on proposing a law but can't secure 100% approval, they have the right to form a new jurisdiction with like-minded individuals. This ensures that government remains small, nimble, and localized.\n\nGovernance Structure\n\nGovernments are run akin to businesses, focusing on efficiency, accountability, and constituent service. Elections are held for CEO, CFO, and COO roles, among others as necessary.\n\nVoting Mechanism\n\nElections use a blockchain-based system, ensuring transparency, security, and integrity. Individuals use unique private keys to sign for a vote. The candidate with the highest votes is elected.\n\nAccountability, Bankruptcy, and Continuity of Governance\n\nShould a government fail to meet its obligations due to financial insolvency, the executive team - comprising the CEO, CFO, and COO, among other roles - is immediately removed from their respective positions. Promptly thereafter, new elections are convened to install a government better equipped to fulfill its responsibilities and serve the interests of its constituents.\n\nDemocratic Trigger for New Elections\n\nApart from financial insolvency, a mechanism exists for the citizenry to trigger new elections. If at any time 50% of the taxpayers within a jurisdiction vote in favor of holding new elections, the process will be initiated immediately, irrespective of the current government's financial status or efficacy.\n\nGovernance Tenure and No Term Limits\n\nThis constitution imposes no term limits on elected officials. Should a set of executives perform extraordinarily well - keeping the government solvent and avoiding the activation of a new election threshold - these individuals may continue to serve in their roles for an indefinite period, potentially until their passing. This is in recognition of the principle that effective governance should not be arbitrarily interrupted but should be allowed to flourish for the benefit of all. The objective is to set clear standards for when a change in leadership is warranted while allowing for long-term stability under competent administration.\n\nGlobal High Court\n\nThe Global High Court serves as the ultimate arbiter for value-based judgments and complex legal matters. One member is elected in every jurisdiction and is elected based on their reputation for neutrality and fair judgment. When cases need to be ajudicated by the High Court 9 of the members will be randomly selected and whichever side has 5+ votes will determine the outcome of the case.\n\nSalary Consensus\n\nUpon official elections, salaries are subjected to community vote, requiring 100% consensus. Elected officials may not vote on their salaries, focusing the role on public service over personal enrichment.\n\nFuture-Proofing Governance\n\nWe recognize that future challenges and technologies may differ drastically from today's. This constitution is designed to adapt, always prioritizing individual sovereignty over unchecked governmental power.\n\n**Article III: Prohibition of Cronyism and Assurance of Market Integrity**\n\nWithin this constitutional framework, the sanctity of free markets is upheld as a cornerstone of our economic system. We affirm the fundamental rights of individuals to own property, engage in trade, start businesses, and innovate, all while preserving the integrity of open and competitive markets. This article serves as a robust safeguard against cronyism and outlines the government's role as an impartial referee in market dynamics.\n\nAffirmation of Free Markets with Rule of Law\n\nFree markets are not to be mistaken as lawless arenas. They are governed by a set of clear, fair, and consistently applied rules. The government acts as an impartial referee, enforcing these rules to ensure fair competition and prevent misconduct.\n\nIndividual Property Rights\n\nEvery individual has an unequivocal right to own, manage, and administer their property - real estate, businesses, or personal assets. This guarantee empowers individuals to make decisions aligned with their interests and values.\n\nDuties to Foster Competitive Markets and Fair Play\n\nThe government is entrusted with fostering an environment where competition thrives. Monopolistic practices, collusion, and anti-competitive behaviors are strictly prohibited. The government's role must be executed without bias, refraining from actions that unfairly influence market dynamics.\n\nBusiness and Taxation\n\nBusinesses are required to pay a 1% sales tax to fund the regulatory mechanisms that ensure fair market play. Those who opt not to pay this tax may still sell their services as individuals but will forego the protections and benefits that come with business status. The government's preferred tax payment method is bitcoin but exceptions will be made on a case by case basis if a business prefers to pay with other methods.\n\nConsequences for Cronyism\n\nCronyism, any undue collaboration or favoritism between government and business entities, is forbidden. Violators face severe penalties, including a minimum sentence of ten years in prison, immediate removal from office, and forfeiture of all government benefits for officials, and asset seizure and dissolution for businesses. In extreme cases, life imprisonment or the death penalty may be imposed, subject to due process.\n\nProtection of Intellectual Property and Contracts\n\nThe government's commitment to free markets extends to safeguarding intellectual property and upholding contracts, allowing individuals and businesses to invest, innovate, and transact with confidence.\n\nEthical and Judicial Integrity\n\nActs of cronyism are treated as severe violations against justice and societal well-being. Offenders will be considered traitors to the cause of all sovereign individuals. To maintain a high standard of ethical and judicial integrity, public officials and agencies are barred from extending special privileges or advantages to any business or individual.\n\nBy establishing these principles, we aim to create an environment where economic freedom coexists with rule-based integrity, where meritocracy prevails, and where the government's role is confined to impartially safeguarding the market and the rights of its citizens.\n\n**Article IV: The Intersection of Technology and Personal Privacy**\n\nIn the Constitutional fabric of our society, the right to employ technology for lawful and benevolent purposes is non-negotiable. This extends to the inalienable right to privacy concerning personal data, communications, and electronic devices.\n\nRecognizing that technology continually reshapes societal norms, we are cognizant of the tension it may generate with nation-states. Sovereign individuals, however, are agile entities, capable of navigating complex landscapes. Entities like Apple, which wield influence exceeding that of many nations, exemplify the transformative power of technology. It is our Constitutional mandate that every sovereign individual shall enjoy the unfettered right to engage with technology for lawful and peaceful ends. This entails the freedom to access, modify, and innovate technological resources without undue hindrance.\n\nWe applaud technological innovation as a force multiplier for societal advancement. We urge all entities - individuals, enterprises, and organizations - to contribute to this collective endeavor. We view technology as an unparalleled tool for fostering universal abundance and remain committed to facilitating its optimal use.\n\nThe inviolability of personal privacy stands as a cornerstone of our society. Sovereign individuals hold an innate right to govern their personal data, secure their communications, and protect their devices.\n\nAny act of surveillance by governmental or non-governmental agencies requires specific, legally-sanctioned warrants, substantiated by probable cause and stringent legal criteria. Failure to comply with these requirements is not merely unlawful but is considered an act tantamount to treason, on par with cronyism.\n\nWe categorically forbid the use, within our jurisdiction, of technologies specifically designed for, or capable of, invasive surveillance. These technologies, which compromise due process and enable unwarranted data collection, are antithetical to our values.\n\nThis prohibition does not extend to universally-accepted technologies like smartphones and computers, provided they are deployed within ethical boundaries and adhere to privacy norms.\n\nThis Article enshrines our dual commitment to technological liberty and personal privacy. While technology can enrich human life in unprecedented ways, it should not serve as a conduit for infringing upon individual freedoms.\n\nTherefore, surveillance is permissible only under exceptional circumstances, sanctioned by due process and legal oversight.\n\nBy explicitly outlawing mass surveillance technologies, we reiterate our unwavering dedication to the sanctity of privacy and civil liberties. This stance ensures that sovereign individuals can reap the rewards of technological innovation without relinquishing their basic human rights and freedoms.\n\n**Article V: Reinforcing Decentralized Governance through Local Autonomy**\n\nIn our unwavering pursuit of a governance model that serves the best interests of its citizenry, we ardently advocate for decentralized governance. We are steadfast in our belief that the levers of governmental authority should be as proximate to the people as is pragmatically feasible, thereby enabling local communities to exercise autonomy in crafting their collective futures. This autonomy is conditionally granted so long as the foundational rights of each individual, as described in Article I, are unimpeachably upheld.\n\nIn alignment with this framework, property-owning individuals who willingly contribute a 1% annual tax on their assets earn the prerogative to suggest changes to their community's governance protocols. However, the introduction of such amendments is contingent upon the unanimous consent of all local residents - a stringent condition that intentionally encourages the formation of smaller, competitive jurisdictions. This design ensures that those who propose laws have a deep vested interest in the community's well-being, thereby instituting a consensual governance paradigm.\n\nOur paradigm for governance is predicated on the principles of local autonomy, coupled with an emphasis on experimentation and innovation. We prioritize these governing tenets above centralized planning and bureaucratic regulation. We contend that the most vibrant and progressive communities are those that emerge from the collective intelligence and aspirations of their residents.\n\nRecognizing that each community has its unique set of needs and values, we champion the decentralization of governmental powers. This allows local jurisdictions to make governance decisions that directly affect their residents. In instances where unanimous consent is unattainable yet a proposed law enjoys overwhelming support, sovereign individuals retain the option to either form new jurisdictions or transition to others that align with their ideals.\n\nWhile we advocate for localized governance structures, we acknowledge that there are complex issues that transcend local boundaries and require overarching adjudication. In such instances, the Global High Court, as established in Article II, serves as the ultimate arbiter. This institution harmonizes the need for localized autonomy with the imperatives of global governance, adjudicating matters that have broad implications or that involve conflicts between multiple jurisdictions. The Global High Court ensures that the principles of transparency, public participation, and individual rights are upheld throughout its proceedings.\n\nLocal communities are encouraged to innovate in the realm of governance, thereby creating a dynamic landscape wherein effective governance models can be propagated and adapted by others. In essence, our approach aims for a governance model that is both agile and respectful of the unique attributes of each jurisdiction while steadfastly protecting the inalienable rights and liberties of all individuals. By doing so, we seek to enrich the democratic process, stimulate local ingenuity, and safeguard the diverse tapestry of sovereign individuals.\n\n**Article VI: The Living Constitution - An Instrument of Evolutionary Governance**\n\nRooted in the ethos of adaptability, this Constitution is a living document, intentionally architected to resonate with the fluctuating needs of an ever-changing society. Acknowledging the inherent unpredictability of the future, we recognize that the challenges of today, in the year 2023, will inevitably differ from those a century hence. To navigate this dynamic landscape, we have instituted a mechanism for Constitutional amendments predicated on unanimous consensus within any given jurisdiction. This unanimity criterion ensures that alterations to this foundational document are only enacted with the comprehensive consent of the affected residents.\n\nOur vision of governance is fundamentally centered on the service of its constituents. Public participation in shaping the governance framework is not merely encouraged; it is deemed essential. We leverage advancements in technology to facilitate this active civic engagement, thereby nullifying the risks associated with the undue concentration of power in any segment of our societal structure.\n\nInspired by the trajectory of innovation, which continually drives the cost of goods toward their marginal production costs, we envision a government that progressively diminishes in relevance. As technological and societal innovations engender abundance and elevate prosperity, the necessity for governmental intervention correspondingly declines. In this model, governance becomes less an overseer and more a facilitator, existing primarily to safeguard the fundamental rights of individuals while enabling the flourishing of collective well-being.\n\nBy enshrining these principles, we aim to forge a governance model that is not static but evolutionary, capable of adapting to the manifold complexities of future generations while safeguarding the core principles that define our society of sovereign individuals.\n\n**Article VII: Primacy of Individual Consent in Governance**\n\nThe bedrock upon which legitimate governance is built is the explicit and revocable consent of its citizenry. This document serves as a manifesto for sovereign individuals, placing the individual - not the state - as the ultimate locus of sovereignty. Anyone adopting this Constitution as their guiding framework must align with this core principle, or they do not qualify as sovereign individuals.\n\nThe tenets outlined in this document are conceived to be voluntarily embraced by sovereign individuals, each providing their consent which can be withdrawn at any moment. When it comes to constitutional amendments, silence or inaction will be interpreted as consent. However, residents bear the onus of vocalizing their dissent should they oppose any proposed changes.\n\nMajoritarian rule shall never be a mechanism to compromise the freedoms or rights of minority groups, except with their explicit consent. The rights of collectives - whether governmental bodies, corporations, or other organizations - shall never supersede the rights of individuals. Individual consent is the non-negotiable precondition for any collective policy or action that has ramifications for individual citizens.\n\nLeveraging the revolutionary capabilities of technology, we are committed to maximizing avenues for individual participation in governance. Our technological infrastructure will provide secure and convenient platforms for citizens to propose, debate, and vote on issues that tangibly affect their lives. In tandem with technological progress, our laws and governance structures will continuously evolve.\n\nTo uphold the sanctity of consent, we have instituted automatic reform triggers. Any actions that erode liberty - such as coercion in voting, obstruction of transparency, or violations of the principles outlined in preceding articles - will activate these triggers. The effect will be a temporary decentralization of authority, reverting power back to the sovereign individuals. Governance will only be re-established once the explicit consent of the governed is re-ascertained and a new jurisdiction is formed with the unanimous agreement of its sovereign constituents.\n\nThrough this article, we affirm our unwavering commitment to a governance model that is both participatory and consensual, thereby ensuring that the voices and liberties of all individuals are rigorously respected and protected.\n\n**In Closing: The Genesis of Our Sovereign Future**\n\nIn crystallizing the principles that guide this Constitution, we initiate a societal metamorphosis - one that transcends traditional barriers and elevates the individual as the nucleus of governance. This document doesn't merely reiterate the virtues of freedom and autonomy; it operationalizes them in a framework that is both agile and robust. This is not a duplication of past efforts but an evolutionary leap, aiming to reconcile the timeless principles of human dignity with the dynamic possibilities of our age.\n\nAs we embark on this transformative journey, let this Constitution be understood as more than a legal instrument. It is a social contract, reimagined. Our focus on the 'consent of the governed' is not a mere philosophical stance; it is the practical bedrock that ensures this framework can adapt, evolve, and sustain itself through the trials and opportunities of the coming epochs. The individual, empowered by technology and invigorated by liberty, is not just a citizen but a co-creator of this emerging societal tapestry.\n\nThis Constitution is not a static parchment but a dynamic interface, capable of capturing the collective wisdom and individual sovereignty of its adopters. It invites active participation, valuing not just the rights but also the responsibilities of each sovereign individual. It acknowledges that our interdependence can coexist with our independence, and that freedom can flourish alongside a foundational set of shared values.\n\nIn this document, we have explored the mechanisms that protect individual rights, limit government intrusion, and define the boundaries of personal freedom. But this is not an end; it's a beginning. Each Article, each clause serves as a launching pad for continual dialogue, revision, and refinement. This Constitution is not an artifact but a living organism, as adaptable and resilient as the individuals it serves.\n\nOur approach to governance is innovative but rooted in eternal human values. We have not shied away from leveraging technological advancements, not as overlords but as enablers of a more transparent, participatory, and consensual governance model. We affirm that the efficacy of this Constitution will not be measured by its immutability but by its capacity to evolve without compromising its core principles.\n\nIn adopting this Constitution, we are not merely drafting a legal framework; we are authoring the future. It is a future that belongs not to states or institutions but to each of us - as individuals endowed with inherent rights and inviolable dignities. This is our manifesto for the new sovereign world, a declaration not just of independence but of interdependence, in a society where freedom is both the means and the end.\n\nAs we unfurl this Constitution, we do so with a vision that reaches beyond the immediate horizon. We are crafting not just a document but a legacy - a testament to human ingenuity and a blueprint for a society that can be as free as it is united, as innovative as it is stable, and as compassionate as it is just.\n\nThus, we affirm this Constitution as our collective proclamation to the world, signaling the dawn of a new era - an era of sovereign liberty, decentralized governance, and endless possibilities. May it serve as our guide, our contract, and our shared vision for a world reborn in the image of the sovereign individual.\n\n10/10/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
