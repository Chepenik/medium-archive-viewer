Here we are, America once again plunging into the quagmire of Middle Eastern conflict, echoing the costly missteps of wars past. Trillions spent, lives lost, and nations left in tatters. The wounds of Iraq and Afghanistan are still raw, yet we wade back into the fray, this time with Iran, as U.S. forces strike nuclear sites under former President Trump's command. The hubris is staggering, but what cuts deeper is the brazen disregard for the Constitution. Trump's decision to unleash bombs without Congress's approval is a betrayal of the very laws that anchor our republic. Declaring war is not a president's prerogative; it's a sacred responsibility reserved for the people's representatives. When the rule of law is flouted at the highest levels, the cracks in our legal system widens, and the ripple effects are felt far beyond Washington.\n\nPower corrupts, and unchecked power festers. When leaders wield authority like a personal sledgehammer, it sets a terrible precedent. People watch, and people mirror. The erosion of accountability at the top trickles down, normalizing chaos and excusing impunity. It's no coincidence that a nation's moral compass wavers when its leaders act as if they're above the law. And yet, the human cost of this war is what haunts most. Iranian civilians, mothers, brothers, daughters, uncles, aunts.... these people are not their government. They are not the architects of this conflict, yet they bear its brunt. To bomb them indiscriminately is to strip away their humanity, reducing them to collateral damage in a geopolitical chess game. It's a gut-wrenching irony: in our quest to protect freedom, we risk becoming the oppressors we claim to oppose.\n\nThere's a strange beauty, though, in how we humanize strangers through shared roles. Calling someone a sister or father bridges the gap between \"us\" and \"them.\" It's less about their individual name and more about the universal ties that bind us. If world leaders could see their adversaries' children as their own, would they hesitate before ordering strikes? Empathy is a powerful antidote to war, yet it's in short supply.\n\nMeanwhile, we're left with the absurdity of our times: the internet spinning out memes the instant war erupts. These darkly hilarious digital jabs are our collective shield, a way to smirk through the trauma of a world where bombs rain down while tweets flood our feeds. It's jarring, surreal, and quintessentially human.\n\nAs an American, I cherish the liberties woven into our Constitution and honor those who defend them. Yet to watch my country lurch into war without Congress's solemn mandate tears at the fabric of our republic, leaving scar tissue on the soul of our nation. It's not merely unlawful, it's a betrayal of the principles we swear to uphold. We must do better. We must demand better.\n\n> **A Prayer for Peace**\n\n> **Heavenly Father,**\n\n> In a world torn by strife and shadowed by war, we turn to You, the source of all peace. Heal the hearts of those who suffer in Iran, Israel, and beyond - mothers weeping for their children, fathers shielding their families, and innocents caught in the crossfire. Soften the hearts of leaders, that they may see their adversaries as brothers and sisters, bound by the same hopes and fears. Grant wisdom to those in power, courage to those who seek justice, and compassion to us all. May Your light pierce the darkness of division, guiding humanity toward reconciliation and understanding.\n\n> We pray for peace, **Lord,** not as a distant dream, but as a reality we build together.\n\n> **Amen.**\n\n6/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
