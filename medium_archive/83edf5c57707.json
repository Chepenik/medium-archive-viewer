It was 3D printed of course, but I used paint markers to color it correctly. It feels good to use your hands to make something.\n\nHere is something cool I saw on X today:\n\n![[https://x.com/cosmicdawg9/status/1906547535537385636](https://x.com/cosmicdawg9/status/1906547535537385636)](https://miro.medium.com/0*NXkYhXc5GrBdzqge)\n\nIt was a declassified CIA document that I found fascinating. So I worked with AI to build - **Consciousness Techniques: A Beginner's Guide**\n\nThis guide explores three powerful consciousness techniques derived from declassified research: Patterning, Color Breathing, and the Energy Bar Tool. Each technique is designed to harness your focused awareness to influence your reality, healing, and energy. The foundation for all these practices is achieving the Focus 12 state of consciousness.\n\nHere is a helpful Youtube video as well for getting in the right mindset:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F60o-pNwOmCE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D60o-pNwOmCE&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F60o-pNwOmCE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n**Understanding the Focus 12 State**\n\nFocus 12 refers to a specific level of consciousness characterized by expanded awareness beyond normal waking consciousness while maintaining mental clarity. This state serves as the foundation for the techniques that follow.\n\n**How to Achieve Focus 12:**\n\n**Begin with Physical Relaxation:**\n\n- Find a quiet space where you won't be disturbed\n\n- Lie down or sit comfortably with your spine straight\n\n- Progressively relax each part of your body from toes to head\n\n**Mental Quieting (Focus 10):**\n\n- First achieve Focus 10, which is \"mind awake/body asleep\"\n\n- Allow your body to feel heavy and deeply relaxed\n\n- Maintain mental alertness as physical awareness diminishes\n\n**Expanding Awareness (Focus 12):**\n\n- Once in Focus 10, begin expanding your awareness beyond your physical body\n\n- Imagine your consciousness extending outward in all directions\n\n- Feel a sense of expanded perception beyond normal boundaries\n\n- Maintain a clear, alert mind while experiencing this expansion\n\n**Using Binaural Beats:**\n\n- Many practitioners use audio technology with specific frequency patterns\n\n- Typical Focus 12 binaural beats operate around 4–7 Hz (theta range) - link is above\n\n- Listen with stereo headphones for best results\n\n**Recognizing the State:**\n\n- You'll know you're in Focus 12 when you feel:\n\n- A profound sense of mental clarity and expanded awareness\n\n- Diminished body awareness but complete mental alertness\n\n- A feeling of being \"larger\" than your physical form\n\n- Enhanced ability to visualize with intensity\n\n**Patterning Technique**\n\n**Core Concept:** This technique uses focused consciousness to manifest desired outcomes by creating \"thought holograms\" that can influence reality.\n\n**Practice:**\n\n- From the Focus 12 state, clearly identify your objective\n\n- Visualize this objective in complete detail as if already accomplished\n\n- Expand your consciousness to include this visualization as part of the \"universal hologram\"\n\n- Project this completed reality outward with confidence and conviction\n\n- Return to this visualization regularly to strengthen the thought pattern\n\n**Theory Behind It:** The patterning methodology is based on the belief that our thoughts in a state of expanded awareness create holographic representations that establish the foundation for actual manifestation. Once a thought-generated hologram of your objective is established, it becomes an aspect of reality that can interact with your current reality to bring about your desired outcome.\n\n**Important Caution:** The document warns against forcing or rushing this process, as there could be consequences from \"dislocating existing reality.\" The more your objective differs from your current reality, the more time the universal hologram needs to reorient to accommodate your desires.\n\n**Color Breathing Technique**\n\n**Core Concept:** This healing technique uses focused visualization of colors to influence the body's electromagnetic field and energy flows.\n\n**Practice:**\n\n- Achieve the Focus 12 state of expanded awareness\n\n- Visualize specific colors with intense vividness and clarity\n\n- As you breathe in, imagine drawing these colors into your body\n\n- Direct these colors to areas needing healing or energetic balance\n\n- Use color associations strategically:\n\n- Blue: Produces rapid reduction in inflammation and swelling\n\n- Red: Stimulates and energizes\n\n- Yellow: Has effects opposite to blue (activating rather than calming)\n\n**Theory Behind It:** This technique is predicated on the principle that the body's electromagnetic field can alter its resonance pattern to entrain energy from the earth's electrostatic field. The colors you visualize cue your mind to specific frequencies and amplitudes, leading to alterations in bodily energy flow patterns.\n\n**Energy Bar Tool Technique**\n\n**Core Concept:** Create a mental tool of concentrated energy for healing and revitalization.\n\n**Practice:**\n\n- In the Focus 12 state, visualize a small, intensely bright dot of light\n\n- Charge this dot with intention until it feels pulsating with energy\n\n- Expand this dot into the shape of a small cylinder or bar of light\n\n- Direct this energy bar to areas of your body needing healing\n\n- Feel the energy transfer from the bar to the targeted area\n\n- When finished, either dissolve the energy back into your system or release it\n\n**Historical Context:** This technique connects to archetypical symbols like scepters, staffs, and wands found across many cultures throughout history. These symbols represent concentrated energy that can be directed for healing and transformation.\n\n## Tips for Successful Practice:\n\n1. **Consistency is Key:** Regular practice (even brief sessions) yields better results than occasional intense efforts.\n\n2. **Progressive Training:** Start with short sessions (5–10 minutes) and gradually increase duration as your mental focus strengthens.\n\n3. **Belief and Expectation:** Approach these techniques with an open mind but without forcing outcomes. Allow effects to unfold naturally.\n\n4. **Journal Your Experiences:** Keep a record of your practice, noting subtle changes in sensation, awareness, and results over time.\n\n5. **Balance Theory and Practice:** Understanding the concepts enhances your experience, but direct practice is essential for developing skill.\n\n6. **Patience with Process:** These techniques develop with consistent practice rather than providing instant results.\n\n7. **Respect Natural Timing:** Allow your desired outcomes to manifest at their own pace rather than forcing immediate change.\n\nRemember that these practices represent skills that develop gradually. The subtle effects you experience initially often precede more noticeable changes as your practice deepens.\n\nIf you want a script so you can practice this with someone I've also turned this into a script. See here:\n\nGuided Consciousness Exploration Script\n Note for the reader: Speak in a calm, soothing voice with gentle pacing. Allow pauses where indicated by [pause]. The entire script should take approximately 15–20 minutes to read aloud. You may want to read through it once before guiding someone else.\n\n**Introduction**\n Find a comfortable position where you can fully relax without falling asleep. You may lie down or sit with your spine straight and supported. Close your eyes and begin to settle into this moment. [pause]\n Take a deep breath in through your nose... and release it slowly through your mouth. [pause]\n Feel yourself becoming more present with each breath. [pause]\n\n**Physical Relaxation**\n I'll guide you now through a progressive relaxation to prepare your body for deeper consciousness exploration. [pause]\n Bring your awareness to your feet and toes. Feel any tension there, and as you exhale, allow that tension to dissolve. [pause]\n Move your attention to your ankles and calves. With your next exhale, let them become completely relaxed. [pause]\n Now focus on your knees and thighs. Release any holding or tightness with your breath. [pause]\n Bring awareness to your hips and lower back. Let these areas soften and relax deeply. [pause]\n Feel your abdomen and chest, allowing your breathing to become effortless and natural. [pause]\n Relax your shoulders, letting them drop away from your ears. Feel any tension melting away. [pause]\n Now your upper arms, elbows, forearms, wrists, and hands - allow them to become completely relaxed. [pause]\n Bring attention to your neck and throat, releasing any tightness or tension. [pause]\n Relax your jaw, letting your teeth part slightly. Relax your tongue, your cheeks, the muscles around your eyes, and your forehead. [pause]\n Feel your entire scalp relaxing. [longer pause]\n Your physical body is now completely relaxed, yet your mind remains alert and clear. You are entering what's known as Focus 10 - mind awake, body asleep. [pause]\n\n**Entering Focus 12**\n Now we'll expand your awareness beyond your physical body to enter Focus 12. [pause]\n While maintaining this deep physical relaxation, begin to imagine your consciousness extending outward in all directions. [pause]\n Feel your awareness expanding beyond the boundaries of your skin... beyond the edges of your body... filling the space around you. [pause]\n Your consciousness continues to expand, like a sphere of awareness growing larger and larger. [pause]\n You remain perfectly centered within this expanding sphere of consciousness. [pause]\n Feel yourself becoming more aware, more alert, even as your body remains deeply relaxed. [pause]\n Your mind is clear, focused, and expanding into a state of heightened awareness. [pause]\n This is Focus 12 - a state of expanded consciousness where your perception extends beyond normal boundaries while maintaining perfect clarity. [longer pause]\n\n**Patterning Technique**\n From this expanded state of awareness, bring to mind something you wish to manifest or experience in your life. [pause]\n See this desire with perfect clarity. What does it look like? What does it feel like? Experience it with all your senses. [pause]\n Now, rather than seeing this as something you want in the future, experience it as if it is already accomplished. Feel the reality of its completion. [pause]\n From your expanded consciousness, project this completed reality outward into the universal field. [pause]\n Know with complete certainty that this reality exists already, and your experience is aligning with it. [pause]\n Feel the gratitude and joy of this manifestation as an established fact. [pause]\n Hold this awareness for a few more moments, embedding it into the fabric of reality. [longer pause]\n Now, gently release this focused intention while maintaining your expanded awareness. [pause]\n\n**Color Breathing Technique**\n Continuing in the Focus 12 state, we'll now work with color breathing for healing and energizing. [pause]\n Imagine a brilliant blue light surrounding you - pure, vibrant, and alive with healing energy. [pause]\n As you inhale, draw this blue light into your body. Feel its cool, calming qualities flowing to any areas of inflammation or tension. [pause]\n With each breath, the blue light becomes more vivid and effective. [pause]\n Now, shift your awareness to a vibrant red light surrounding you. This is the color of vitality and strength. [pause]\n Breathe in this energizing red light, directing it to any areas needing stimulation or increased circulation. [pause]\n Feel the warming, activating quality of this red energy. [pause]\n Finally, imagine a bright, clear yellow light all around you. [pause]\n Breathe in this yellow light, feeling its balancing and uplifting qualities. [pause]\n Allow these colors to harmonize within you, creating perfect balance. [longer pause]\n\n**Energy Bar Tool Technique**\n Still maintaining your expanded awareness, imagine a small point of intensely bright light forming about six inches in front of you. [pause]\n Focus your attention on this point of light, seeing it grow brighter and begin to pulsate with energy. [pause]\n As you focus, this point expands into a small cylinder of light - like a wand or bar of pure energy. [pause]\n See this energy bar becoming more defined, pulsating with powerful healing potential. [pause]\n In your mind, take hold of this energy tool and direct it to any part of your body needing healing or revitalization. [pause]\n Feel the energy transferring from the bar to this area, bringing balance and renewal. [pause]\n Take your time working with this energy tool, directing it wherever it's needed. [longer pause]\n When you're ready, allow the energy bar to dissolve, its light spreading throughout your entire being. [pause]\n\n**Returning to Normal Awareness**\n Now we'll begin the process of returning to normal awareness while retaining the benefits of this session. [pause]\n Feel your expanded consciousness gradually condensing, bringing back with it all the insights and energies you've accessed. [pause]\n Begin to reconnect with your physical body, feeling your limbs becoming more present. [pause]\n Take a few deeper breaths, inviting gentle movement back into your fingers and toes. [pause]\n When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, carrying this centered awareness into your day.\n You've completed this consciousness exploration session. Remember that these skills develop with practice, and each session builds upon the last.\n\n— - -\n\nI did this tonight and it feels good. I know it sound a bit wooh-wooh but try it. Don't trust me go verify for yourself. My guess is you will be pleasantly surprised. :)\n\nI'll end this with something else that most people might roll their eyes at, but I think probably has some truth.\n\n![[https://x.com/mazyostovany/status/1906600523220041734](https://x.com/mazyostovany/status/1906600523220041734)](https://miro.medium.com/0*xgixNcAFM4ZrjVH3)\n\nHep-b vaccine for new borns is what I would say to the haters. Not for my new born, of course, but for any new borns in the hospital who don't have parents educated on why they should not give their precious new born that poison. There are evil spirits out there. Elevate your consciousness anon. There is a higher level we can all achieve. I love you and only want to see humanity thrive - I know deep down you want the same.\n\n3/31/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
