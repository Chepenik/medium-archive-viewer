  "content": "# Day 4\n\nGreat friends are the ones who you pick up right where you left off after not seeing them for a while. Having friends like this is priceless. Playing sports throughout my adolescence afforded me the opportunity to make some extraordinary friends. I like to joke that I like my friends the same way I like my money: decentralized. Getting to visit my buddies across the United States is one of my favorite past times. Traveling is great but it's even better when you're going to visit a buddy who knows all the good local joints.\n\nToday is going to be a short one because I am fighting demons in the airport as I write this. The biggest problem I've found with getting older is the hangovers get worse and worse. Also all the taxes and bills lol.\n\n3/26/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
