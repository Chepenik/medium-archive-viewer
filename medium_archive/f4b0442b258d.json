  "content": "# Day 406\n\nI find that the blank canvas can be both a source of inspiration and a daunting task. It represents endless possibilities and infinite potential, yet the pressure to create something meaningful can be overwhelming. One should overcome this fear and use the blank canvas as a platform for self-expression and creativity.\n\nI need to meditate more. Regarding the topic of meditation, I recently listened to a podcast series that discussed the discovery of zero by a monk who was meditating. It was fascinating to learn how this monk's practice of mindfulness and contemplation led to such a groundbreaking discovery that would shape mathematics and science for centuries to come.\n\nThe discovery of zero not only revolutionized mathematics but also solidified the existence of infinity. Zero is a concept that represents nothingness, and its discovery allowed for the creation of the decimal system, which enabled the expression of numbers in a more concise and systematic way. This paved the way for the concept of infinity, which is also represented by the number zero. The existence of zero allows for the expression of infinite numbers, and it is this understanding that has allowed us to explore and comprehend the vastness of the universe and its mysteries.\n\nI started writing tonight without any clear direction, feeling daunted by the blank canvas before me. However, it turned okay.\n\nZero and infinity may seem like opposing concepts - zero representing nothingness and infinity representing the boundless - but they are inherently connected. In fact, one could argue that they are two sides of the same coin. Zero provides a starting point, a baseline against which to measure other numbers. Infinity, on the other hand, represents the limitless possibilities beyond that baseline. Together, they create a framework for understanding the vastness of the universe.\n\nThe discovery of zero, like all great breakthroughs, was the result of curiosity, exploration, and a willingness to challenge established beliefs and assumptions. It serves as a reminder of the importance of these qualities.\n\nPersonally, I feel like infinity is the glass half full perspective while zero is the glass half empty. Of course, the glass is still the glass no matter how you look at it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*RXfgxbMKsmkb09iS.jpg)\n\n5/2/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
