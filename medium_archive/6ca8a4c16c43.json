  "content": "# Day 1078\n\nMan, what a day. The varsity team lost in the championship game, but it was a hell of a season. Those kids fought hard and overcame two good teams to get to the championship, beating the #1 seeded team in the semi-finals. In the final game, I could've coached better, and we gave up a safety on a trick play. I should've been more clear in my instructions, and that's on me.\n\nAnyway, when I was giving the final speech of the season, it was a reminder of how fleeting things are. They say death and taxes, but an even better phrase would be death and change. Life changes so fast. I'm proud of what the kids accomplished and I wish I had another season with them, but they are graduating elementary school and moving up to middle school. The JV will become varsity, and the varsity will presumably have to play middle school ball.\n\nEither way, I learned so much from those kids. How important your attitude is. Crazy phrases for talking trash like \"put the fries in the bag\". I learned the power of motivating kids, giving speeches, and having fun. I think my team did best when we were loose and having a good time. I'm grateful God gave me the chance to coach. This opportunity really just randomly popped into my lap, and it was a fun one. I hope I get to coach my own kids one day.\n\nThat said, I'm looking forward to having some more free time now to write, to code, and to get back into a good exercise routine. Tradeoffs with everything and the tradeoff I faced with coaching flag football is there was less time for my other extracurricular activities.\n\n3/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
