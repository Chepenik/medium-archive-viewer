  "content": "# Day 1094\n\nToday, while I was busy working, my stepfather-in-law and stepdad generously came over to help start renovating my backyard. It's incredible how much progress they made in just one day. These men are true doers! Thanks to their hard work, my backyard is now almost ready for new sod.\n\nIt's amazing what you can accomplish when you set your mind to something. I'm excited to see the finished result. The plan is to install a backyard sail to provide some shade during the hot summer months and a pull-up bar for daily hangs and workouts. We're also planning to pour concrete for a new patio and lay down fresh sod once we get everything leveled.\n\nI'm deeply grateful for my family. After work, I got to have dinner with my wife, kid, father, and stepfather-in-law. Sloan is especially lucky. Counting her step-grandpas, she has four grandfathers, all of whom adore her. She's surrounded by so much love.\n\nFamily makes life better. I genuinely do not know what I would do without them.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*bYn3EaCf3yvBh90CH28QiA.png)\n\n3/20/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
