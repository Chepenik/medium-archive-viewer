  "content": "# Day 446\n\nWas exposed to an interesting article today. Here is the quick summary: Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US Congress created the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to help reduce nuclear, chemical, and biological threats left in the Soviet Union's successor states, including Russia. The US and other countries, international organizations, and the International Science and Technology Center have worked together through the program to reduce the risks of weapons of mass destruction. Ukraine has no nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons program and is a leader in promoting nonproliferation and global health security norms.\n\nThe link\n\n> [**Fact Sheet on WMD Threat Reduction Efforts with Ukraine, Russia and Other Former Soviet Un**](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3057517/fact-sheet-on-wmd-threat-reduction-efforts-with-ukraine-russia-and-other-former/)\n\nAs well as the paragraph that I found interesting.\n\n- The United States has also worked collaboratively to improve Ukraine's biological safety, security, and disease surveillance for both human and animal health, providing support to 46 peaceful Ukrainian laboratories, health facilities, and disease diagnostic sites over the last two decades. The collaborative programs have focused on improving public health and agricultural safety measures at the nexus of nonproliferation.\n\nThat's right 46 peaceful Ukrainian laboratories. Thank God they were not violent laboratories. Jokes aside, if anyone knows what a peaceful laboratory is please comment and let us all know!!\n\nTwitter is full of signal. I've got no more smart or witty comments to make about a bloody war. My priority is stopping it. I hope politicians look at their children and decide to end this madness. It was wrong what Putin did and the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result. However, America is not without blame. This tweet makes some very good points I don't spend much time thinking about because the MSM doesn't like to note this RuSsIaN DiSiNfOrMaTiOn.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/CamHamm8/status/1667672797886259203%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThere are no heroes in a war. Humanity has so much potential and it saddens me that we are fighting right now.\n\nGood will win though. Keep being brave, keep being honest, keep fighting the good fight ‚úäüèº\n\n6/11/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
