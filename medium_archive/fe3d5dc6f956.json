It's worth reading the whole thing, and I was talking to chatGPT about this afterwards:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*wtlGesDzt0oMk-6re6_24g.png)\n\n\"And when our opinions become holy, we stop repenting and start defending. We become gatekeepers instead of grace receivers.\" That is so good. Man I love that.\n\nI asked ChatGPT if it believes in a higher power.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*rCLw7KeOWygKb1HA)\n\nI believe humans are extraordinary because we possess souls. I'm deeply grateful to The Father for blessing me with a soul of my own. I'm also thankful for entrusting me with the care of new souls to nurture and guide. My heart overflows with gratitude for all the gifts He has bestowed upon me. God is good.\n\n4/13/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
