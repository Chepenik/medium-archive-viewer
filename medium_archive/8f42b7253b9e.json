  "content": "# Day 1237\n\nToday I read my Daughter some Dr. Seuss and it inspired me to write a Bitcoin themed children's book. So with a little bit of powerful AI prompting I made a whole story with images. It needs to be finetuned. No doubt about that, but with due time I might have a second children's book ready to go. It is genuinely mind blowing how much productivity and creativity these models will release in people. I'm excited for the future. If you don't believe [watch this](https://youtu.be/515Ykn-zFdQ) or check out the below and tell me that this doesn't bring a smile to your face :)\n\n**Page 1**\n\nIn the twinkly-winkly town of Tip-Tap-Tun,\nWhere the Truffula-like trees dance orange in the sun,\nThe Tip-Tappians traded with glee and with cheer - \nSwapping snook-berries, socks, and root beer!\n\nThey'd swap-a-ma-jig and they'd trade-a-ma-jag,\nWith shells in a sack and treats in a bag.\nTill Mayor McMint (with his mint-colored hat)\nSaid, \"This swapping's too slow! We can't have all THAT!\"\n\n![Colorful Tip-Tappians trade berries, socks, and root beer in a bright, happy town under a smiling sun.](https://miro.medium.com/1*R4_tbMEv1G-xn2sjTt7Thg.png)\n\n**Page 2**\n\nSo he built a Big Bank with a ZOOK-ZAPPING machine!\nThe most money-printing contraption you've seen!\nWith a WHIRR and a PURR and a great big KA-POW!\nIt printed up paper - and plenty of it NOW!\n\n\"Look here!\" cried McMint, \"No more trading delay!\nThis money-machine makes it easy to pay!\"\nBut the Zook-Zapper hummed a most curious tune:\n\"Print-a-lot, print-a-lot, morning and noon!\"\n\n![Mayor McMint stands by the smiling Zook-Zapper machine as it shoots paper money into the air.](https://miro.medium.com/1*zb2btVRQT0nzU2e8Kl31hw.png)\n\n**Page 3**\n\nThe Tip-Tappians cheered, \"What a wonderful thing!\"\nThey'd shop-a-lot, buy-a-lot, coins on a string!\nBut soon the town square was all flutter with bills - \nFloating like leaves over Tip-Tappy hills.\n\nMore and more money went round and around,\nTill it covered the streets and it covered the ground!\nAnd then something funny (but not funny-ha-ha)\nBegan to happen to every mama and papa...\n\n![Tip-Tappians chase swirling paper bills in a windy town square filled with Truffula trees.](https://miro.medium.com/1*tZamIBmQ2bkUaS7LFo__eA.png)\n\n**Page 4**\n\nA Truffula fruit that cost two little coins,\nNow cost them a bundle! (Oh, my aching loins!)\nA loaf of Wumbo bread jumped from one buck to four,\nTheir money bought less than it had before!\n\n\"Our coins!\" cried the people, \"They're shrinking somehow!\"\n\"A Sneetchy-fruit smoothie costs ten dollops now!\"\nThe Zook-Zapper hummed its dangerous song:\n\"The more that I print, the less money is strong!\"*\n\n![Penny the Pig points to \"INFLATION!\" bubbles as animated bills run off with coins.](https://miro.medium.com/1*nH8G3nJ-AwV7cft180CRNw.png)\n\n**Page 5**\n\nThen Penny the Pig (with her polka-dot nose)\nSquealed out the truth that everybody knows:\n\"It's INFLATION!\" she oinked, \"When money's made plenty,\nYour piggy bank's worth becomes not-worth-a-penny!\"\n\n\"It nibbles your nickels! It chews up your change!\nIt makes all your money act terribly strange!\nWhen mayors make money like baking a cake,\nYour savings will shrivel for goodness' sake!\"\n\n![A kind stranger shows curious Tip-Tappians a glowing golden Bitcoin.](https://miro.medium.com/1*nbrISbBAxj9BWZfQa73Puw.png)\n\n**Page 6**\n\nThen one Tip-Tappy day, when the sun was just right,\nA stranger appeared with a coin shining bright!\nHe wore a strange hat (neither tall, short, nor wide),\nWith a mysterious smile and stars in his eyes.\n\n\"Behold!\" said the stranger, \"This Bitcoin, you see,\nIs digital money as special as can be!\nNo mayors can make it! No banks can create it!\nIt's honest as honey - you cannot deflate it!\"\n\n![Tip-Tappians gaze at a night sky filled with 21 million Bitcoin-shaped stars.](https://miro.medium.com/1*XGUz3t09fzm9VfySbNG23Q.png)\n\n**Page 7**\n\n\"It lives in the computer-space, cloudy and high,\nBut only twenty-one million exist in the sky!\nNo printing, no pressing, no Zook-Zapping here - \nThe number stays constant from year to year!\"\n\nThe Tip-Tappians gasped, \"But who makes the rules?\nWho watches the watchers? Who minds the jewels?\"\nThe stranger just twinkled, \"That's the beautiful part - \nThousands of helpers with one beating heart!\"\n\n![Friendly robot computers in mining helmets hold hands and check each other's work with magnifying glasses.](https://miro.medium.com/1*tw0DewJEz2lGfqmT_aosIg.png)\n\n**Page 8**\n\n\"They're called miners, my friends, though they don't dig for coal,\nThey're computers connected from pole to pole!\nThey talk in a language of ones and of zeros,\nThese digital, bitcoin-protecting heroes!\"\n\n\"Each one checks the others - they never can cheat!\nIf someone tries fibbing, they're in for defeat!\nThe network says 'NO!' to each lie and each trick,\nAnd keeps all the Bitcoin both honest and slick!\"\n\n![The stranger shows Mayor McMint a tall, glowing tree of transparent, patterned blocks.](https://miro.medium.com/1*jxrGUbYCZRrmZYaMyr1ILw.png)\n\n**Page 9**\n\n\"But HOW?\" asked McMint, with a frown and a scowl,\n\"Without central control, it's just digital howl!\nWho keeps it all straight when there's no one in charge?\nHow do you manage a network so large?\"\n\n\"Ah-HA!\" said the stranger, \"That's blockchain, my friend!\nIt's a ledger that stretches from start until end!\nEach block holds transactions, all linked in a chain,\nAnd everyone sees it - sunshine or rain!\"\n\n![Penny the Pig jumps beside a giant floating book with sparkling, see-through pages.](https://miro.medium.com/1*2iAchqTaY3q8dUjhEkkzrw.png)\n\n**Page 10**\n\nPenny the Pig squealed with glee and delight,\n\"It's like one big book that's open and bright!\nEveryone reads it, but no one can change\nThe words that are written - now isn't that strange?\"\n\n\"Strange but wonderful!\" laughed the mysterious man,\n\"No mayor, no banker, no government plan\nCan alter the history or change what's been done - \nBitcoin belongs to everyone!\"\n\n![Tip-Tappians happily choose between paper money, gold coins, and a glowing Bitcoin wallet in a rainbow playroom.](https://miro.medium.com/1*UirRN7KEhOSqN0ZPh8kyug.png)\n\n**Page 11**\n\nNow some Tip-Tappians learned about this new way\nTo save up their money for some future day.\nThey'd keep some in paper, some gold in a drawer,\nAnd Bitcoin in digital wallets for sure!\n\nNo more would they worry their savings would shrink,\nWhen mayors went printing with barely a think!\nFor Bitcoin stayed Bitcoin, through thick and through thin,\nA treasure that no one could meddle within!\n\n![Tip-Tappians shop with paper, coins, and glowing screens at a cheerful marketplace.](https://miro.medium.com/1*T0nrv1QQCOoteSMb5el01A.png)\n\n**Page 12**\n\nBut not every Tip-Tappian wanted to switch - \nSome liked their paper (a traditional itch).\nAnd that was just fine! For choice is the thing\nThat makes people happy from peasant to king.\n\nSome shopped with paper for this and for that,\nSome saved golden coins in a blue money hat,\nAnd some sent Bitcoin with a click and a tap,\nAcross the whole world in a digital zap!\n\n![Tip-Tappians learn about scarcity, gold, paper money, and Bitcoin in a magical classroom.](https://miro.medium.com/1*UALYYmhhpDFN4seKFtrsZQ.png)\n\n**Page 13**\n\nThe town learned that money comes in different forms,\nLike sunshine and snow and thundery storms.\nSome grows when you plant it, some shrinks when it's pressed,\nAnd some stays the same - and that might be best!\n\nThey learned about scarcity (a big fancy word),\nThat means \"not too many\" - like a rare singing bird.\nWhen something stays rare, it keeps all its might,\nLike stars in the darkness or day after night.\n\n![A joyful bird's-eye view shows Tip-Tap-Tun with rainbow houses and the Zook-Zapper turned playground.](https://miro.medium.com/1*0GFyZuy31-1p2K_xcH0uXg.png)\n\n**Page 14**\n\nSo if you should visit Tip-Tap-Tun today,\nYou'll see people spending in every which way!\nWith paper and Bitcoin, with gold and with shells,\nEach choosing the money that serves them quite well.\n\nBut listen for whispers of digital treasure,\nOf Bitcoin, the money beyond human measure.\nIt hums in the air like a blockchain lullaby,\nA network of trust that reaches the sky.\n\n![The stranger waves goodbye under a Bitcoin constellation as Tip-Tappians hold their chosen money.](https://miro.medium.com/1*h3qq6aUCMsCytYMtcpz1qQ.png)\n\n**Page 15**\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, you'll smile and you'll see\nThat money's a choice for both you and for me!\nSome people print paper (like Mayor McMint),\nSome dig golden coins from the digital mint.\n\nBut Bitcoin's a story still being told,\nOf freedom and fairness, brave and bold.\nWhere no single person can control the whole game,\nAnd that makes Bitcoin wonderfully... NOT THE SAME!\n\n![A Tip-Tappian sits in a library surrounded by glowing question marks, lightbulbs, and money diagrams.](https://miro.medium.com/1*94UQcvrhAf9pDCWmysi6GA.png)\n\n**Page 16**\n\nSo remember, dear reader, when grown-ups decide\nWhat money to use, keep your eyes open wide!\nAsk questions like: \"Who gets to make more?\"\nAnd \"Will my piggy bank buy less at the store?\"\n\nFor money's not magic, though it might seem so - \nIt's made by the choices that help our world grow.\nAnd whether it's Bitcoin, or gold, or the rest,\nThe fairest of money serves everyone best!\n\n![Ask Questions - Choose Wisely](https://miro.medium.com/1*JU93uVVlfW1W27xalaWXTg.png)\n\nThe End\n(What Is Money?)\n\n...\n\nAlso proud to report I was able to keep myself off Twitter since last Sunday. I'm excited to have X/Twitter privileges again, but I do think it's best to spend less time on that app.\n\nReal life is better than a screen, although I continue to be impressed by what the screens can do. Future looks bright!\n\n8/10/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
