  "content": "# Day 1003\n\nOne idea I had was to build an app where people submit a question and I give an answer via a nice note that only includes handwritten quotes.\n\nSo a person submits their problem and I only respond with 3 handwritten quotes to answer their question. The nice touch of a handwritten note could be cool. I would only accept Bitcoin. Something nice and lowkey. I like the idea.\n\nI think by only accepting sats I can filter out the noise, find a unique audience who is interested in nice handwritten quotes and notes.\n\nBoom I made the website here: [https://quotestoansweryourquestions.replit.app/](https://quotestoansweryourquestions.replit.app/)\n\nI'm in hacker mode.\n\nJust hacking things together. Doing stuff. Building in the arena (of my home and cyberspace)\n\nWhat a freaking time to be alive.\n\nGrateful, truly grateful.\n\n12/19/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
