  "content": "# Day 1062\n\n_\"I love you, Dada.\"_\n\nI hope every man reading this gets to hear those words one day, especially if you have a daughter. I never knew my heart could melt so completely, but the moment my little girl said it, I felt it turn to liquid. And then she smiled like the universe had just handed me its greatest gift.\n\nIt is amazing what a dad will do for his daughter. She reads me like a book, knows exactly how to pull me back in. And yet, even knowing this, when she starts to cry because _\"Daddy has to do some work,\"_ I still find myself right back beside her, tucking her in, whispering stories, watching her drift off to sleep. The work can wait.\n\nI wouldn't trade these moments for anything in the world. I am so unbelievably blessed.\n\nI love you, Sloan. No words will ever be enough to capture how lucky I feel or just how much love I have for you.\n\n2/16/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
