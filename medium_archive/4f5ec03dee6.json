  "content": "# Day 480\n\nI am ghost writing a book so today is going to be about improving one of the chapters.\n\n...\n\nDespite the incredible advancements we've made in science, the human mind remains a captivating enigma. We've come a long way, but the more we explore cognition and consciousness, the more we realize we're just scratching the surface of how our brains work. It's like trying to uncover a hidden secret, but the deeper we go, the more mysterious it becomes. Our minds are like a veil that conceals the very essence of who we are, leaving us in awe of the endless wonders within our own heads.\n\nPersonally, diving into the realm of the mind has made me aware of the profound challenges that come with being diagnosed with a progressive autoimmune disease. The toll it takes on my body is clear, but the impact on my mental well-being is even more difficult to grasp. Losing simple abilities like buttoning a shirt or tying a tie may seem insignificant, but the weight of maintaining a positive outlook on life feels heavy and burdensome.\n\nThere's a saying that goes, \"There are no atheists in a foxhole.\" Tough situations really make people think twice about religion and spirituality. Although I grew up in a Jewish household and went to temple, my personal faith in God didn't hold much significance in my everyday life. However, experiencing a traumatic event has a way of increasing one's faith. Embracing the belief in a higher power overseeing my life's journey has brought me comfort and solace when I needed it most. Cultivating a strong sense of spirituality remains vital to me.\n\nAs my disease progresses, my world steadily shrinks, week after week, month after month, year after year. I have transitioned from being a gym enthusiast, dedicating my days to physical exercise and weightlifting, to cultivating strength and resilience within my own mind. It is truly remarkable how the human mind can adapt to such a negative prognosis and continue to grow. It requires courage - a willingness to confront and intimately understand fear, anxiety, and nervousness. Personally, I strive to exist in a state of flow as often as possible, cultivating an intimate relationship with all emotions. By embracing fear rather than resisting it, I find that it can be conquered. This philosophy of personal intimacy with fears has been a transformative practice for me.\n\nAnother tool I employ is what I call \"Granted to Grateful.\" I consciously convert everything I typically take for granted into a source of gratitude. For instance, I am grateful for the simple act of waking up in the morning, sharing a meal with my family, or enjoying a wonderful time with friends. It takes practice, but by deliberately acknowledging and appreciating each experience, we can shift our mindset from entitlement to gratitude. The more we engage in this exercise, the easier it becomes, eventually becoming our natural state. I encourage you to give it a try - I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nIn addition to these practices, I utilize various tools to navigate the physical and psychological burdens thrust upon me by this disease. These tools include meditation, deep breathing exercises, journaling, prayer, music, and finding meaning. They provide solace and assist in coping with the challenges that arise. As Nietzsche wisely stated, \"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\" Similarly, Viktor Frankl asserted that \"to live is to suffer, and to survive is to find meaning in the suffering.\"\n\nIt is crucial to cultivate a connection with a higher power to preserve one's mental well-being. By praying to and expressing gratitude towards a higher entity, we can find solace and alleviate distress. You cannot be grateful and unhappy simultaneously. Frankl also emphasized the importance of choice, stating that everything can be taken from a person except the freedom to choose their attitude in any given circumstance, to choose their own way. Moreover, he noted that life becomes unbearable not due to circumstances alone but rather from a lack of meaning and purpose.\n\nExploring effective strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, therapy, self-reflection, and nurturing healthy relationships is essential for maintaining mental well-being. By integrating these practices and insights into my journey, I aim to fortify my mental resilience, finding strength in the face of adversity and discovering profound meaning and purpose along the way.\n\n...\n\nAs I round up the final day of my first ever week long fast I think all these points about gratitude are so spot on. I'll tell you I'm super grateful about getting a chance to wake up tomorrow and enjoy a meal. I will never underestimate the power of subtraction in my life again. What's that old saying, \"You never realize how much you value something until it is gone\" or something like that.\n\n![AI art of a couple enjoying a picnic together](https://miro.medium.com/1*KQjmk5amqFikI-TVqylGbA.png)\n\n7/15/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
