  "content": "# Day 369\n\nPlayed some basketball today and swooshed a 3 pointer to win the game. While it was just a random game of pickup basketball it still feels good to wet a 3 pointer for the win. Sports are such an incredible thing. I'm grateful I've been able to play so many different kinds of sports throughout my life. I hope no matter what age I reach that I don't stop playing. Likely to be more golf and pickleball once I cross the 40â€“50 age range but still I love those sports too.\n\nToday I had my article about Bitcoin and homebirth published in Bitcoin Magazine. Feels good to get nice feedback and joke about how I found a way to relate Bitcoin and homebirthing.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1639998992674181121%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI also thought of a funny meme while in the shower. Enjoy :)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1640108826866208768%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nMemes are the best. So funny how we can distill complex ideas into things people shitpost on their timelines. Memes don't have to be photos either. This Guy Swan video was excellent.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1640138947626934275%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nAre actions matter way more than we realize. Enjoy each day, keep stacking those positive habits, and have fun. Life is too short to remain miserable! Plus alll these technologies are going to make our lives so incredible if you just focus on the correct ones, not the ones trying to psy-op everyone.\n\n3/26/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
