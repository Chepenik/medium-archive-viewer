Then come back and view these memes.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*vyjMhnkjl2KYYTAZVlOHzQ.png)\n\nHahahaha these internet crossover memes crack me up. The memetic power of the internet to facilitate customization is incredible. Here is one more meme which I hope future generations can look back on and also appreciate because Twin Peaks is goated. Seriously one of my favorite TV shows all time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*TVkas0_xhwAMt6lKNRASAg.jpeg)\n\n7/22/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
