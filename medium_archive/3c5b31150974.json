  "content": "# Day 642\n\nThe best products are those which don't need to be sold. Why? Because everyone wants them. Selling ice cream on a hot day is considerably easier than in the depths of winter. Products that everyone wants require little effort to sell.\n\nSuch products include\n\n- money\n\n- sex\n\n- drugs\n\n- rock and roll\n\n- plenty of other things\n\nMany items on this list are vices. However, not all high-demand products are vices, nor do they need to be. Depends on context everyone has their own demons to battle.\n\nI appreciate those who use their time to master a skill. To perfect a craft.\n\nBecoming obsessed with something is easy. Staying obsessed with that thing is hard. Find what brings you purpose so you can stay passionate. Life is better with passion.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*paJKJwEEDz0CVlpv)\n\nAlso, Merry Christmas Eve. Stay Frosty❄️\n\n12/24/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
