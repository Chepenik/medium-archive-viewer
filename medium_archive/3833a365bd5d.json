Hardest part about being a Bitcoiner is just being patient. Not looking for yield on your coins, not keeping them on an exchange, not trying to time the tops and bottoms. Just being monk like and learning that your stack is x/21 million bitcoins that will ever exist. Getting to this point for most takes a lot of pain but it's worth it when you reach the point of pure bliss that comes from knowing your wealth will be preserved over time if you just hodl accordingly.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1595512579417378837&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nWe are living in absolutely insane times. I don't understand how this guy is going to be speaking when he is literally a fraud and criminal. Bernie Madoff didn't get to go speak on live TV after he was caught I'm pretty sure? I guess I wasn't around so I'm speculating based off this tweet, but like come on... SBF was just as bad if not worse than Madoff!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/fintwit_news/status/1595517061987459082&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI'm glad Sorkin is saying there is no questions off limit and trust me I'm excited to watch this interview but Odell is right. He was running a casino based on a ponzi scheme.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/odell/status/1595564791908671495&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n2022 has been an absolutely wild year and we still got over a month left. Talk to you tomorrow anon :p\n\n11/23/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
