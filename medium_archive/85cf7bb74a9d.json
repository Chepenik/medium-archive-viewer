It's a sad day for democracy. A jury in New York found Donald J. Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money trial. It's a historic moment, as he's the first former president to be found guilty of a felony. Not exactly the kind of \"first\" one would aspire to achieve, but here we are.\n\nI'm not even the biggest fan of democracy. I find this Churchill quote to be apt:\n\n> _'Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time....'_\n\nOf all the things to convict a politician for, they decide to do it for hush money to a porn star? If someone does not think this is a politically motivated trial, I would urge them to turn off the legacy media. Seriously, let's start convicting all the war criminals on both sides of the aisle. That would make the world a better place.\n\n![[https://x.com/Geiger_Capital/status/1796348525523144862](https://x.com/Geiger_Capital/status/1796348525523144862)](https://miro.medium.com/1*cws7HsUw7WC9BETRAMEkyw.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1796276304209178684](https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1796276304209178684)](https://miro.medium.com/1*bpm2PJ7h_TooXA3pr8Blng.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/piersmorgan/status/1796301496528814217](https://x.com/piersmorgan/status/1796301496528814217)](https://miro.medium.com/1*t_lPlqgNuECJAEinWnQkDQ.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1795853430725996737](https://x.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1795853430725996737)](https://miro.medium.com/1*mxf-l_huoTZh5qXBy_dELQ.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/Chesschick01/status/1796006876598902817](https://x.com/Chesschick01/status/1796006876598902817)](https://miro.medium.com/1*KKZvruuUIylhWW2dp1JcEg.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1796300390566388213](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1796300390566388213)](https://miro.medium.com/1*kXvnCgknfTpwKTYfS4Oywg.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/Oilfield_Rando/status/1796339471123927042](https://x.com/Oilfield_Rando/status/1796339471123927042)](https://miro.medium.com/1*23WvIK5Z48LGwI9oLNRhLQ.png)\n\nI watched Mad Max: Furiosa today, and it was a stark reminder of how swiftly society can descend into chaos. We often take the rule of law for granted, but the American people are not naive. I hope those in power realize the dangers of driving the world toward turmoil just to maintain their grip on authority. In such a scenario, everyone loses.\n\n5/30/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
