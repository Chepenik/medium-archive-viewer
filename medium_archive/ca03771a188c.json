  "content": "# Day 1125\n\nToday was a beautiful Easter Sunday: quiet, grounding, and full of grace. I went to church with my family, which always reminds me how deeply faith ties us together. There's something sacred about stepping into God's house, being surrounded by others raising their voices in praise. The energy in that room was healing. You could feel it in the stillness, in the songs, in the collective devotion. When I feel The Holy Spirit in my body, it's always a pleasant rush of sensation in my spinal cord. It starts as a warm rush at the base of my spine, then climbs, gentle and electric, through my neck and into my head. It's hard to describe, but it feels like love made physical. Like God lighting up my whole being from the inside out.\n\nAlso, the Easter memes? Absolute fire. God really is the greatest for giving people good senses of humor.\n\n![[https://x.com/zackvoell/status/1913963999953121394](https://x.com/zackvoell/status/1913963999953121394)](https://miro.medium.com/1*IjkrkyLnT8ilO7KJAiCjfw.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/SopranosWorld/status/1913997771977183627](https://x.com/SopranosWorld/status/1913997771977183627)](https://miro.medium.com/1*pUyQbTqaOMATzkBKKhRUDQ.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/William_E_Wolfe/status/1913814962088067556](https://x.com/William_E_Wolfe/status/1913814962088067556)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZfEa2MDlB_65jnNl1usHSw.png)\n\nSolid jokes aside what struck me the most in today's service was this: suffering without God is just pain, it's suffering without purpose. But when we bring our pain to God, it can become something holy. If we're going to suffer, let it not be in vain. Let it be for His glory. Even in sorrow, even in hardship, praise be to Him in the highest.\n\n4/20/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
