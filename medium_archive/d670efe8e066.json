  "content": "# Day 1229\n\nIt felt good to start my detox from Twitter. Also feels good to mow my lawn, go for a 2 mile run, enjoy a dinner with my family, and play some PGA 2k21. Crazy how even if exercising can be painful in the moment, the end result always feels so good. So vital to move the body even if it's something as simple as just going for walks.\n\nLong way to say I had a good day.\n\nChurch tomorrow, then the beach.\n\nBlessed. Thank you God.\n\nI was listening to a podcast called moonshots that was discussing AI. The pace of change I will see in my life is going to be insane.\n\n![[https://primal.net/e/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzp4qgk4dfevf2zvfsjkkvxdkuu9wk5hz77wj5p50vatmlh9l23ec2qqsvuuc0hqnzw4fak2d9alyv389pplv95877uhx5sccwcjsxezts9ggykp3za](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzp4qgk4dfevf2zvfsjkkvxdkuu9wk5hz77wj5p50vatmlh9l23ec2qqsvuuc0hqnzw4fak2d9alyv389pplv95877uhx5sccwcjsxezts9ggykp3za)](https://miro.medium.com/1*iWrso09SAnd1BxY_X3IjYw.png)\n\nAs funny as this is AI is going to be quite the tool and a Hal Finney quote constantly comes to mind.\n\n> \"The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them\"\n\nI hope the humans building AI remeber this quote for the sake of humanity. Future looks bright when we build the bots to enable everyone.\n\n8/2/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
