  "content": "# Day 464\n\nI've noticed that on Nostr a lot of people will post links to Twitter. Which makes sense because the participants of Bitcoin Twitter make up a big portion of Nostr. However, I've gotten a real kick out of posting Nostr screenshots on Twitter. I'd like to grow the network effects of Nostr and showing people all the signal that can be found on this protocol is a good starting place.\n\nI was going back through my old posts and saw this. Pretty cool that the creator of Twitter hit me with a shaka after posting about the birth of my child on Nostr.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*vq7JUR-NUQVgSVAH0AX1Mg.png)\n\nBa based.\n\nIn other news the Supreme Court overturned the ability for colleges to use affirmative action which in my opinion is fantastic. College admission should be merit based not race based. Reverse racism is still racism. It's amazing that the tweets I'm going to put below are not parody.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1674518436884488193%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/simonateba/status/1674542293536129027%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/nytimes/status/1674422849011089411%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nWhat a world we live in! Here's a clever parody tweet I came across. Now, I must clarify that 'good' here is subjective, based on my personal opinion. It's truly mind-boggling to think that there are individuals who consider reverse racism as the solution to racism. While some argue that labeling affirmative action as reverse racism is unfair, I hold a different view. In my perspective, if two individuals possess equal merit, and race becomes the determining factor, it crosses the line into racism.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/TheBabylonBee/status/1674423976247037954%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3D4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThe Babylon Bee really does have a gold mine of content recently with ü§° üåç  continuing to clown world. Thank God the creator blessed your boi with a great sense of humor. Gratitude goes a long way and I am quite grateful for my ability to laugh at things.\n\n6/29/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
