  "content": "# Day 1021\n\nThere's something contagious about getting stuff done, and something even more contagious about coping with the fact that there's just \"so much\" to do. Procrastination is paralyzing. It is like a heavy cloud reminding you of the thousand things you need to finish. Then you do one thing, get that dopamine rush, and wonder why you didn't start sooner. Next thing you know, you're onto task number two, dopamine surging through your brain.\n\nSo stop procrastinating. Just get to it. That was me today after a loooooong drive from Jersey back down South. Once I finally stopped feeling sorry for myself and did what I needed to do, I felt amazing.\n\nSure I could write more, but it's been a long day. So instead I will share a nice picture from the journey.\n\n![If you are on the fence about starting a family, I can tell you it is so worth it anon ‚ù§](https://miro.medium.com/1*LQ7XHdoNP9oJUke5i3ysug.png)\n\n1/6/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
