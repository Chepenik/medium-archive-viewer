  "content": "# Day 985\n\nI'm currently 3D printing a chess set, which is a testament to the incredible advancements in technology that allow us to create complex objects with ease. Earlier today, I stumbled upon a YouTube video that showed me how to build a fire pit from scratch for only ~$250 dollars. I plan on building one myself in 2025.\n\nIt is mind-boggling to think about the sheer amount of information and resources available to us, enabling us to bring our ideas to life.\n\nWe live in a world where online and physical stores are overflowing with cutting-edge tools, materials, and innovations that were previously unimaginable. The possibilities are endless, and it's exhilarating to think about what we can achieve with a little creativity and determination.\n\nThe cycle of innovation is beautifully simple: conceive, design, build, refine, and enjoy the fruits of our labor. The sense of satisfaction that comes from creating something with our own hands is unparalleled, and it's a feeling that's now more accessible than ever, thanks to the help of technology.\n\nGo forth and build.\n\n![An AI generated image of a backyard I hope to build](https://miro.medium.com/1*VhS3zc_DC6Evi7RlbYULzg.png)\n\n12/1/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
