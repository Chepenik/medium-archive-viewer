I fear Bo is right.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/sovrynmindset/status/1587957800243716096&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI see myself spending more and more time online. There are things about it that are great. The ability to learn and connect with people I would not be able to otherwise. I also feel like my dopamine receptors are being fried and my eyes hurt from staring at a screen all day at work only to come home and start staring at a screen more.\n\nI'm going to overcome. I will figure it out. These companies don't own me. They are just a tool that I can choose to use or not to use. Speaking of I need to journal on paper more. I appreciate what Medium provides and will still be writing for at least 365 days. I just think there is also value in writing down your thoughts on paper rather than typing everything.\n\nUntil tomorrow.\n\n11/3/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
