While strategically stacking sats is prudent, especially after understanding why Bitcoin is the most sound money humanity has ever created, one must never lose sight of the fundamental reason we seek wealth in the first place.\n\nMoney, in any form, is merely a tool - a means to an end. It provides security, freedom, and the ability to fulfill our needs and aspirations. Whether it's acquiring a home, safeguarding our family's future, or achieving personal goals, the ultimate aim is to elevate our quality of life. Wealth accumulation should never become an end in itself, but rather a means to support a fulfilling and meaningful existence.\n\nWhile prudent financial planning and seeking economic freedom are noble pursuits, its mid when they overshadow the pursuit of experiences, relationships, and personal growth that bring genuine fulfillment. For what good is amassing a fortune if one neglects to live a life rich in meaning, love, and purpose?\n\nOf course, the drive for wealth accumulation can itself be a source of passion, purpose, and personal growth for some individuals. That is one key to a good life. Going through the challenge of building a successful business or investment portfolio can be deeply fulfilling and provide a sense of achievement and self-actualization.\n\n6/11/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
