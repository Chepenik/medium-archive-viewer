History bears witness to the unimaginable depths of human depravity. I have been listening to some of these tragedies today on my drive back home after visiting my Grandparents this weekend.\n\n> [**Fear & Loathing in the new jerusalem - Martyr Made Podcast**](https://www.martyrmade.com/featured-podcasts/fear-loathing-in-the-new-jerusalem)\n\nIt was episode 2 in specific I was listening to which discussed how starvation has driven people to acts so vile that they defy comprehension. And yet, amidst this darkness, the message of Jesus Christ resonated with me, offering hope, redemption, and the radical power of forgiveness.\n\nThe notion of forgiveness, as embodied by Jesus, transcends human logic. It is not merely about releasing grievances or relinquishing pain. It is about embodying the highest form of divine consciousness. In a world fractured by sin and suffering, forgiveness is the bridge between broken humanity and the grace of God.\n\nJesus' ability to forgive even his greatest enemies, those who mocked, scourged, and crucified him, was not born of naivety nor weakness. It was rooted in his divine understanding of the interconnectedness of all souls. He saw beyond human failings, recognizing that sin blinds the heart, that fear corrupts judgment, and that ignorance leads men to commit atrocities they do not fully comprehend. When he cried from the cross, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do\" (Luke 23:34), he was not excusing their actions but exposing the tragedy of spiritual blindness.\n\nForgiveness, in the eyes of Christ, is not merely an act of mercy - it is an affirmation of our shared humanity, a testimony that no soul is beyond redemption. He understood that the human condition is fraught with weakness, that men stumble and fall, and that even the most wretched sinner is within reach of God's grace. To forgive is to recognize the inherent worth of another, not because of their deeds, but because they, too, are made in the image of God.\n\nThis radical forgiveness does not come easily. It demands a profound shift in perspective, one that sees beyond the sins of an individual and into the soul that God seeks to redeem. It requires the humility to acknowledge that we, too, are recipients of unmerited grace. \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). If we are all sinners in need of forgiveness, how can we withhold from others what we ourselves have so freely received from Christ?\n\nMoreover, forgiveness is not only an act of compassion toward others but a liberation of our own souls. To hold onto anger and resentment is to chain ourselves to the pain of the past, allowing bitterness to consume us from within. But Christ calls us to something greater. \"Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you\" (Ephesians 4:32). In forgiving, we mirror the love of God, stepping out of the cycle of vengeance and into the peace that surpasses understanding.\n\nJesus' teachings on forgiveness are inseparable from his revelation of divine love. He did not merely instruct his followers to forgive; he demonstrated it with every breath, even as he faced betrayal, torture, and death. His forgiveness was not theoretical. It was lived, bled, and ultimately victorious over the grave. Through his sacrifice, he showed us that true power does not lie in domination or revenge but in love so profound that it conquers even the greatest of sins.\n\nWhen we forgive, we do not condone evil, nor do we diminish the reality of pain. Rather, we testify that the love of Christ is stronger than sin, that grace is greater than vengeance, and that redemption is always possible. The cross stands as the ultimate proof that no darkness is beyond the reach of divine mercy.\n\nThus, when we ask how Jesus was able to forgive even his greatest enemies, the answer is found not in human reasoning but in the depths of divine love. It is a love that sees the fallen and lifts them up. It is a love that meets humanity at its worst and offers the gift of salvation. It is a love that calls us to follow his example, to forgive as we have been forgiven, and to be the light of Christ in a world desperate for redemption.\n\n![Jesus died for our Sins so we could be forgiven. What a powerful thing!](https://miro.medium.com/1*Tm0M2UR1nxEzJX9nHrKH6g.png)\n\nIn the end, forgiveness is not just an act of grace: it is the very heartbeat of the Gospel. It is the declaration that no sin is too great for God's mercy, no heart is too hardened for His touch, and no soul is too lost to be found. When we forgive, we proclaim the victory of Christ, and in doing so, we step into the fullness of the love that has already set us free. I am not perfect and I get this wrong all the time. But I hope this essay serves as a reminder, mostly for myself, forgiveness is key. Revenge begets more revenge. Our world needs more love, more compassion, more forgiveness.\n\n3/16/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
