  "content": "# Day 484\n\nIt is dope how much we can customize our environment. In person, online, even the hardware we use for our mobile phone. I think it's easier to customize your online environment, but it is much more important to customize your meat space environment. Each person is unique. Somewhere around 8 billion of us living on this planet currently. Give or take .2 billion. That is so many people who have different preferences, perspectives, hopes, goals, dreams, and everything else a human has.\n\nThere is absolutely no denying some human are much smarter than others. That said, thinking about the vastness of the world is humbling. What's even crazier is the earth in comparison to just our solar system is smaller than each individual human on the planet compared with the earth. I fact checked this with Bard so it may or may not be true. Everyday I want to get better at cherishing the time I have here because this feels like a real special place and time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*0mLRtmtN2WhjRChVHD1elw.png)\n\nTrust, but verify. The decisions that humanity make moving forward will have a profound impact on our species moving forward. Think about it: internet, ai, magic internet money, and more opportunity than humanity has ever had in the past. At least it seems that way. This is one reminder for myself to enjoy the warmth of a hot shower, the touch of a loved one, and the simple moments where I'm not thinking about something cool which in the big scope of things is nowhere near as important as my family and the relationship I have with them.\n\nAlso remember!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\/\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Z0YUt-RGwLtEduLj)\n\n7/19/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
