Reflecting on the luxuries I enjoy, I realize that even the most prosperous individuals a century ago would marvel at the conveniences I often take for granted. Today, I stumbled upon an insightful post by Andrew Axelrod on LinkedIn, which prompted me to reflect further.\n\n> [**Andrew Axelrod on LinkedIn: #bitcoin #banking #money #business #tech | 87 comments**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewmarkaxelrod_bitcoin-banking-money-activity-7058185903369809920-fcX0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)\n\nIn his post, Andrew shed light on a profound notion: tomorrow's middle class will experience a quality of life surpassing that of today's billionaires. It may sound incredulous at first, but as I delved deeper into his words, I found myself captivated by the potential of our future. The pace at which technology and innovation are advancing is simply remarkable. Exponentially remarkable!\n\nAs we scroll through social media feeds, it's effortless to succumb to a sense of inadequacy or envy, convinced that others lead perfect lives while we grapple with our own challenges. However, we must remember that social media rarely showcases failures or struggles; it is a highlight reel of carefully curated moments. We all face obstacles, setbacks, and doubts in our journey, but they seldom find their way onto these platforms.\n\nInstead of dwelling on the illusion of others' flawless lives, let us appreciate the progress we have made and the privileges we possess. We have at our fingertips an unprecedented wealth of knowledge, connectedness, and opportunities for personal and professional growth. Our ability to access information, communicate instantaneously across the globe, and tap into a vast network of resources is truly extraordinary.\n\nConsider the transformative power of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which Andrew touched upon in his post. The emergence of Bitcoin has disrupted traditional banking systems, opening up new avenues for financial inclusion and innovation. As we embrace the potential of money that can't be debased, we witness the democratization of wealth and the erosion of economic barriers that once seemed insurmountable.\n\nLet us not underestimate the progress we have made and the possibilities that lie ahead. In this era of rapid change, it is crucial to remember that we are the architects of our own destinies. The future holds the promise of even greater advancements, and it is within our reach to shape a world where the middle class of tomorrow will enjoy unprecedented abundance.\n\nCherish the present, celebrate your own victories, and contribute to the collective progress of humanity. If you have to take a step down on the proverbial \"stairs\" fret not because with sound money those steps will become an escalator lifting humanity up. I'm excited for a future of win-win situations once humanity rids itself of our fiat disease.\n\n5/9/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
