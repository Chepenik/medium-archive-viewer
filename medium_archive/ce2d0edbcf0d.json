It's like having a universal remote that can fast-forward through the boring parts and mute the annoying ones. Plus, it's a great way to avoid stepping in the metaphorical dog crap of other people's problems.\n\nWe live in a hyper-connected world, where it's easy to get sucked into the black hole of social media debates, arguing over who should have won the last season of \"The Bachelor\" or whether pineapple belongs on pizza (spoiler alert: it does). Unless you're 100% sure you want to waste your precious time and energy on such trivial matters, it's best to keep your opinions to yourself and save your strength for the battles worth fighting.\n\nRemember, life is too short to get caught up in the never-ending cycle of online arguments, unless of course you like arguing with the chatGPT API. Take a deep breath, put down your phone, and go do something productive. Trust me, it'll be a lot more entertaining than arguing with bots on the internet.\n\nP.S This advice is to myself but if you got value out of it anon, cheers.\n\n6/19/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
