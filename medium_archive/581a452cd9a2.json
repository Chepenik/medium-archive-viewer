  "content": "# Day 370\n\nLife is what you make of it. \"Yea no shit Chep that's obvious\".\n\nIs it though? Do we really think about that everyday as we go through life. As bills, responsibilities, and other bullshit tasks pile up are we thinking about how we are going to spend our time on things we find valuable? Maybe you do, but I know that I don't spend enough time thinking about these things.\n\n> [**Bitcoin's Meme Wars | dergigi.com**](https://dergigi.com/2023/03/21/bitcoin-s-meme-wars/)\n\nGigi nailed it with this one. There is so much hope for the future. We are getting on a hard money standard backed by math and open source software. You can get left behind or you can adopt with the changing times.\n\n3/27/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
