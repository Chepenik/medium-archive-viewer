  "content": "# Day 1172\n\nFridays always hit different. I know we shouldn't hype up the weekend so much, but I'd be lying if I said I don't love reaching the end of the week. I'm grateful to work in Bitcoin and genuinely enjoy my job, but there's something about Friday that just kicks ass. It's like having a job is a privilege because it makes the weekend feel like a well-earned reward.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1931092159760843157](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1931092159760843157)](https://miro.medium.com/1*HxQGKZ2gXfI4WP0LjCY6CQ.png)\n\nAnyways, I don't have much else to say. I'm going to go enjoy dinner with my family now :)\n\n6/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
