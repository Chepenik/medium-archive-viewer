Also bullish on AI as a teacher. Tonight I had a fantastic conversation with ChatGPT and my daughter. We were talking about irrational numbers. She's only two so a lot of it probably didn't make sense to her. But we still explored pi, e, and the square root of two. And honestly, I think she's starting to absorb some of this stuff in her own way. At the same time, having AI explain this stuff out loud, especially in simple terms, helped me understand it better too. AI is not just useful for generating images or writing drafts. It can actually help you think more clearly, learn more deeply, and even turn regular moments with your kid into something meaningful. So yeah bullish on people who use AI to improve themselves and who do so thoughtfully.\n\n5/11/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
