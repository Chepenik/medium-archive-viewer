  "content": "# Day 765\n\n[My company](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/conorchepenik/) recently published a comprehensive report on Bitcoin mining, and I wanted to share some of the fascinating graphics and insights it contains.\n\n![[FREE REPORT - The Current State of Bitcoin Mining April 2024 - Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-current-state-of-bitcoin-mining-april-2024/)](https://miro.medium.com/1*6u5HYpSFjKR8EGh_d2h7FA.png)\n\nSo beautiful is Bitcoin's monetary policy, impervious to the whims and interventions of fallible human institutions. This unchangeable framework, etched in code rather than dictated by central planners, ensures a predictable and transparent supply schedule - the bedrock of trust and stability for society's most vital ecosystem: money itself.\n\nBy removing the power to arbitrarily inflate or manipulate the money supply, Bitcoin has ushered in a new era of monetary sovereignty for individuals. No longer must we place our faith in the promises of governments or central banks, whose actions are often driven by political expediency rather than sound economic principles.\n\nThis unchangeable monetary policy is the cornerstone of Bitcoin's value proposition, fostering confidence in its long-term viability first as a store of value, next as a medium of exchange, and ultimately as a unit of account. It represents a paradigm shift, a departure from the inherent fragility of fiat currencies, and a bold step towards true financial freedom for all. It is a massive operating system upgrade for the market human's call money.\n\nBitcoin is hope - a money that belongs to the people, governed by immutable laws rather than the whims of the powerful few. Learning about mining and why it's so important to Bitcoin is also pretty cool.\n\n![[FREE REPORT - The Current State of Bitcoin Mining April 2024 - Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/the-current-state-of-bitcoin-mining-april-2024/)](https://miro.medium.com/1*E8_kbHWLMn_XdY71Y5KtmA.png)\n\n4/25/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
