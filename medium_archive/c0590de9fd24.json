  "content": "# Day 507\n\nThis morning I posted a note on Nostr that read, \"I never wake up, wanting to do a run to start my morning but boy do I feel better when I dominate my inner bitch and do it anywaysðŸ˜¤ \" It is true. Doing uncomfortable things sucks in the moment but feels so much better when you're done with the uncomfortable thing. Life encompasses struggle, prompting a choice: embrace the challenges that yield growth and transformation, or opt for the path of evading discomfort, which ironically often breeds more enduring agony. Opting for the former not only lets you emerge stronger but also shields you from the lingering 'what-ifs' that arise when you ponder the road untaken.\n\nIn other news, this song has blown up recently. Amazing we live in a time where people can produce something of such quality it goes viral.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FsqSA-SY5Hro%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsqSA-SY5Hro&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FsqSA-SY5Hro%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nI'm not sure if this dude is a Bitcoiner, yet, but in his soul I know this guy is a Bitcoiner. There is something so real about this song, it just exudes a raw authenticity. Though difficult to articulate, the visceral sincerity of his emotions rings clear. The singer's passion is palpable - you can feel the fervor in his voice yearning for liberation. There's a contempt toward those who disingenuously peddle self-righteous agendas solely to consolidate control. The scorn comes from an astute awareness that kleptocrats' with large sums of money aren't interested in helping others even if they virtue signal. Anyone who is not completely indoctrinated can clearly see the real motives are to gain more control. Listen to this song if you want to hear the sound of a soul bursting for emancipation from the duplicitous overlords we have running our Government.\n\nThis is why we will win. The innate human longing for freedom is an undeniable force, and it's only natural that a song which captures this profound yearning with such sincerity would spread like wildfire across the digital landscape.\n\n![A brave human slaying the beast of tyranny generated on nightcafe.studio](https://miro.medium.com/0*_LDy3q1fekVHIFIp)\n\n8/11/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
