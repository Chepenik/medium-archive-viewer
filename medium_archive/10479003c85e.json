  "content": "# Day 996\n\n![I like the stock](https://miro.medium.com/1*Sl1KARxtnuEL0X4YjRRsSA.png)\n\nBitcoin is money. It is not a stock. Not a bond. Not an IOU. It is a bearer asset represented with public/private key pairs.\n\nYou can draw them on paper. Put them on steel. Keep them in your head.\n\nWHATEVER YOU CHOOSE. That is the beauty of decentralized money. Of Math. Of an honest ledger humanity can not censor, steal, or debase. It is a glorious thing my friends.\n\nSo come and adopt a better monetary operating system. Look what it has done for Microstrategy's returns. No seriously go verify for yourself.\n\n![[https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/MSTR/performance#:~:text=What%20is%20the%205%20year,for%20MSTR%20stock%20is%202%2C298.82%25](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/MSTR/performance#:~:text=What%20is%20the%205%20year,for%20MSTR%20stock%20is%202%2C298.82%25).](https://miro.medium.com/1*Mg5ZR3IkSEK0wwjq3wgVKQ.png)\n\n![[https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/MSTR/performance#:~:text=What%20is%20the%205%20year,for%20MSTR%20stock%20is%202%2C298.82%25](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/MSTR/performance#:~:text=What%20is%20the%205%20year,for%20MSTR%20stock%20is%202%2C298.82%25).](https://miro.medium.com/1*KfuTIc-i9ugjqJH0LjEq5A.png)\n\nYou don't hate to see a 25x return on your money.\n\nAll Microstrategy did was adopt better money. You can too. Shout out Saylor as well for realizing better money means a much better business.\n\n![[https://youtu.be/R87vco0jHvo](https://youtu.be/R87vco0jHvo)](https://miro.medium.com/1*4TSs10j741GNsxpCREa2Yw.png)\n\nB & CJC\n\n12/12/24",
