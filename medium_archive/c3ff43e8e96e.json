  "content": "# Day 167\n\nFound out my dog Kobe had his spleen erupt and now he is getting put down today. Growing up there were so many moments of me wanting to kill Kobe for being a little shit. There were even more moments of him being the best companion a high school kid could ask for. Kobe \"The beef man\" Chepenik was the most amazing dog in the world and I'll miss him dearly. All the times he would growl when I stopped rubbing him. Can't blame the dog I love being rubbed too. He was our families protector and I know his spirit is in a better place. It's funny how much personality dogs have. I feel even more for my Dad who loved that Dog as much as he loved me. R.I.P Kobe you were an amazing dog.\n\nLife is precious. We only get so much time on this planet and today is a reminder to cherish it. I don't have all the answers but I know that life is truly a gift. Some days are better than others but we are all damn lucky to be here breathing.\n\nI've always enjoyed self-help books.\n\n> [**How to Get 30.5 Times Better At Anything**](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/how-to-get-30-5-times-better-at-anything-11ea9d8149c6)\n\nAnd now self-help medium posts. Fitting image to capture the ethos of that writing. In my own life I've been so caught up with the plan I've put off the work. Nothing can beat the work. Time to grind. Life is more rewarding when you follow your dreams and put in the work to achieve them. No more dilly dallying. Time to make moves. Self-help books have their place... in bed after a hard days workðŸ˜ˆ\n\n9/5/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
