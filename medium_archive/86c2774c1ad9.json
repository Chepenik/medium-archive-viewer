Enter [BetOpenly.com](https://x.com/BetOpenly), where the bets are peer-to-peer, the juice is low, and Bitcoin isn't just welcomed; it's celebrated. Let's dive into the story of how Gino, a former bookie turned tech innovator, is revolutionizing the betting world.\n\nGino's tale begins in the Bay Area, amidst the hustle of an Italian family where sports bets were as common as pasta on Sundays. \"As a kid I didn't understand like odds and lines, I just knew the Niners win,\" Gino reminisces. His journey from casual bettor to college bookie set the stage for a career pivot that would marry his love for sports betting with the disruptive tech of peer-to-peer platforms.\n\nAfter witnessing the tech boom and the rise of giants like Uber and Twitter (both of which, he admits with a laugh, he passed on becoming an employee for), Gino had his lightbulb moment chatting with friends. \"What could put bookies out of business,\" he pondered, envisioning a marketplace that could revolutionize sports betting. His idea: combine the best parts of Uber and Twitter in the sports betting world.\n\n![What The BetOpenly Website Looks Like](https://miro.medium.com/1*vuFl3NMcwnRMg9kE6hp13A.png)\n\nBut Gino's journey wasn't just about innovation; it was about addressing a fundamental issue in the betting world. \"Regulation was the enemy of any sort of innovation whatsoever in the space,\" Gino explains. He points out the irony of how, while other industries were becoming more efficient and cost-effective, sports betting was moving in the opposite direction. \"It's complete monopolies ran by crooked attorney generals,\" he says, highlighting how overregulation was making legal sportsbooks even more expensive than many bookies. This realization fueled Gino's determination to create a more efficient, user-friendly alternative.\n\nHere's where BetOpenly gets interesting: it's not just another betting site; it's a betting community where you set the terms. With only a 1% fee, Gino boasts, \"We're 90% less than our competition, almost 95% less than most of it now.\" The platform's design is so intuitive, Gino advises, \"Create the exact bet you want, don't overthink bet openly... The software does everything else for you.\"\n\nAs BetOpenly spread its wings internationally, Gino hit a snag with currency conversion eating into many of his clients' profits. His solution was as bold as his platform: Bitcoin. \"I need a global currency,\" Gino realized, embracing Bitcoin not just as a payment method but as a philosophy. \"Bitcoin really aligns with all my ideals,\" he explains, \"it's very fluid you can send extreme amounts... quickly at low fees.\"\n\nImportantly, BetOpenly doesn't force users to adopt Bitcoin. \"You don't have to bet in Bitcoin on BetOpenly, you just have the choice,\" Gino clarifies. This approach allows international users to avoid the fees associated with currency exchanges, offering a more cost-effective solution for cross-border betting.\n\nBetOpenly isn't just playing in the sports betting sandbox; it's redesigning the playground. By leveraging peer-to-peer dynamics and the power of Bitcoin, Gino and his team are not only reducing costs but are also making betting more accessible and efficient on a global scale. \"We actually hold all of our profits in Bitcoin,\" Gino reveals, underlining his commitment to the digital asset.\n\nAs BetOpenly continues to grow, it's not just betting on sports; it's betting on the future of finance and technology. Gino's journey from a teenager taking $10 bets to running a global betting platform that embraces Bitcoin is a testament to the evolving landscape of sports betting. And from where we're standing, it looks like a winning bet.\n\nIn the world of BetOpenly, the house doesn't always win - because there is no house. To be fair, the house does take their 1% juice, but this is a much more straightforward payment than the house feeding you free drinks while you play a game that's designed to enrich the house. With BetOpenly, it's just you, your bets, and a world of possibilities, all powered by the revolutionary combination of peer-to-peer technology and Bitcoin.\n\n![Betting With Bitcoin Is Better When You Can't Access Dollars](https://miro.medium.com/1*gsDqs_M4GTn8U2HcbDTNzA.png)\n\n8/27/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
