  "content": "# Day 830\n\nThe realization that much of our indoctrination is built on falsehoods can be jarring. I've come to believe that unlearning ingrained ideas is far more challenging than absorbing new ones. This isn't to claim I have the answers, because I sure as hell do not. I've just become convinced that a significant portion of what the majority of people are told about things is, at best, a half-truth. It's crucial to approach information with a critical eye and resist blindly accepting narratives pushed by legacy media outlets. Question everything, especially the stories that seem most comfortable and familiar.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*jvtLX4BgaJH6zBLV)\n\n6/29/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
