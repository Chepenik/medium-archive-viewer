It Changes You**\n\nGrowing up, my father often told me that I wouldn't truly understand the challenges and joys of parenthood until I had a child of my own. At the time, I found this notion frustrating, even infuriating. After all, our family had dogs that required constant care and attention, and I thought that was similar enough. But as it often does, experience proved to be the best teacher. It wasn't until I became a parent myself that I realized the profound truth in my father's words. The moment my child entered this world, I felt a shift in my heart that's difficult to put into words. It was as if my very capacity for love and compassion expanded in an instant.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*2JiZ8TmhCgjDJkQR7hBFGQ.png)\n\n**2. Your Bloodline Lives On**\n\nWhat's the point of accumulating wealth, fame, power, and success if there's no one to inherit and build upon our legacies? Humans have an innate desire to shape the future and leave a lasting impact. The continuation of our species relies on the next generation, and without children, our collective future would be bleak. A society without young people would be a world without hope, vitality, or purpose. The fundamental drive to survive and procreate is a primal urge that has propelled humanity forward, despite our many flaws. Without children, humanity would wither and disappear, a fate even worse than the dinosaurs' demise.\n\nIt's no coincidence that visionaries like Elon Musk, who is working tirelessly to make humanity a multi-planetary species, are also devoted parents. When we have children, we're motivated to create a better world for them to thrive in. We want them to bring pride to our family's legacy and to give them every opportunity to succeed. By having kids, we're not only ensuring the continuation of our bloodline but also investing in the future of humanity.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*mqfDGU0iM8bPtffGIrtEkg.png)\n\n**3. You Become A Better Member Of Society**\n\nSpending time with kids can be a transformative experience. Despite their occasional tantrums and energy surges, children have a way of bringing out the best in us. As we learn to navigate their unique personalities and needs, we develop patience, empathy, and understanding - essential qualities for building stronger relationships with adults as well. By nurturing our children's natural empathy, we're encouraged to reexamine our own interactions and behaviors. We become more mindful of our actions, more considerate of others, and more aware of the impact we have on those around us.\n\nAs parents, we're constantly being watched and emulated by our children. They absorb our values, attitudes, and behaviors like sponges, and it's up to us to set a positive example. It's not rocket science: when we teach our kids solid skills, model good behavior, and show them kindness and compassion, they're more likely to grow up to be capable, confident, and caring individuals. Research has confirmed what we intuitively know - that children who learn social-emotional skills from their parents tend to thrive in life. But we don't need studies to tell us that our influence matters. We can see it in the way our kids mimic our actions, respond to our emotions, and develop their own values and principles.\n\nAs Robert Fulghum so aptly put it, \"Don't worry that children never listen to you; worry that they are always watching you.\" This simple yet profound truth should motivate us to be our best selves, not just for our children's sake, but for the benefit of society as a whole. By becoming better role models, we can create a ripple effect of kindness, empathy, and compassion that extends far beyond our own families.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*fm8FCdpMa0zTXzxCjar2Iw.png)\n\n**4. How Kids Help You See the World with Fresh Eyes**\n\nToday, my child ran out onto the balcony during a rainstorm, twirling and spinning with abandon, completely carefree. At first, my adult instincts kicked in, worrying about the mess and the need for a change of clothes. But then I heard her laughter, pure and unadulterated, and my concerns melted away. How could I possibly scold her for experiencing such unbridled joy?\n\nAs adults, we often get caught up in worries about providing for our children, stressing about expenses and financial security. But the truth is, kids don't need a lot of money to be happy. What they crave most is our attention, our presence, and our love. Give a child your undivided attention, and they'll be over the moon with delight. You'll also discover that you don't need to break the bank to have fun. Kids can teach you how to find joy in the simplest things, like playing in the rain, watching a sunset, or exploring the backyard.\n\nBy seeing the world through our children's eyes, we can rediscover the magic and wonder that we may have lost as adults. We can learn to appreciate the little things, to find happiness in the everyday moments, and to live more fully in the present. So, take a cue from your kids and let go of your worries. Get outside, get messy, and experience the world with fresh eyes.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*g2sVHLtGS5iXYC8EydzSuw.png)\n\n**5. The Gift of a Lifetime**\n\nAs I've watched my parents and grandparents become grandparents, I've seen them transform in ways I never thought possible. They've been given a new lease on life, a fresh sense of purpose and energy. It's as if they've been rejuvenated by the presence of their grandchild. But what's even more remarkable is the impact it's had on our family as a whole. We've become closer, more connected, and more loving.\n\nA quote that has stuck with me captures this journey perfectly: \"In youth, you see your father as a hero; in adolescence, you challenge him as a foe; in maturity, you understand him as a human.\" This progression from idolization to demonization to humanization is a natural part of growing up, but it's only when we become parents ourselves that we truly appreciate the complexities and challenges of our own parents' experiences.\n\nHaving a child isn't just about creating a new life, it's also about giving back to those who have given so much to us. It's a way of showing our parents and grandparents that we appreciate everything they've done for us, that we're grateful for the sacrifices they've made, and that we want to bring joy and happiness into their lives. What better way to do that than by giving them a grandchild to love and spoil? As I look at my parents and grandparents now, I see them in a new light, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to bring them joy and happiness through my child. Giving my parents the gift of a grandchild has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, and I know that it's something that will bring us closer together as a family for years to come.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*v4ZV2IKLmZhSzMJ2Vc_88Q.png)\n\n**6. How Parenthood Brings Us Closer to God**\n\nAs I reflect on my journey as a parent, I'm reminded of the biblical mandate to \"be fruitful and multiply.\" For me, having a child has been a deeply spiritual experience that has brought me closer to God. It's a powerful reminder of the divine miracle that unfolds with every new life. The idea that a simple union of cells can result in a complex, living being with a soul is truly awe-inspiring. It's a testament to the boundless creativity and power of our Creator.\n\nAs I watch my child grow and develop, I'm constantly reminded of the mysteries of life that are beyond human understanding. Despite the advances of science and technology, we still can't replicate the spark of life that animates every human being. We can clone animals, but we can't create a soul. This realization is both humbling and liberating, as it points us to a power greater than ourselves.\n\nFor me, having a child has strengthened my connection with God and deepened my faith. It's a daily reminder of the beauty and wonder of creation, and the incredible privilege it is to be a part of it. Whether through biological birth or adoption, becoming a parent is a sacred trust that allows us to experience the joy and responsibility of nurturing a new life. I'm grateful every day for the gift of my child, and I thank God for the opportunity to watch them grow and thrive.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*VAU6I8fqnvQ_3892H5RAUg.png)\n\n**7. Children Are A Legacy Worth Investing In**\n\nAs I conclude, I want to emphasize that the decision to have children is not just a personal choice, but a vital investment in the future of humanity. With birth rates declining across the world, it's more important than ever that we prioritize building strong, loving families. Not only do children bring joy and fulfillment to our lives, but they also represent the next generation of leaders, innovators, and problem-solvers who will shape the world to come.\n\nThe return on investment of having children is unparalleled. It will eclipse the gains of Bitcoin, the world's best performing asset ever, because the rewards of parenthood are eternal. The love, laughter, and memories we create with our children are truly priceless, and the impact they have on our lives is immeasurable.\n\nSo, I urge you: don't delay, don't put it off until you've achieved some arbitrary milestone. Find the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, and start building your legacy together. Your body, mind, and spirit will thank you. Ignore the naysayers and pessimists who would have you believe that having children is a burden or a mistake. They are wrong.\n\nThe truth is, there are two fundamental forces at work in the world: those who seek to build, create, and nurture life, and those who seek to tear it down. I choose to stand with the former. I choose to believe in the goodness, light, and potential of humanity. And I invite you to join me. Let's build a brighter future, one family at a time. The world needs it, and the ROI is worth it.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*UuUwZFa9GX1YtQ6KY6EWsw.png)\n\n9/4/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
