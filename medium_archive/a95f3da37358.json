  "content": "# Day 1121\n\nWhat a nice pleasant day it was. Work was busy, but we had a great all-hands team call. After I got off from my 9â€“5, I enjoyed dinner with my grandma, dad, cousins, sister, and daughter. I even got to watch the sunset with my lil lady today, which was a nice treat.\n\n![Turned our sunset watch photo into a studio ghibili photo](https://miro.medium.com/1*bDTOYMgam5eLKuEL78Clpw.png)\n\nAfter our walk, Sloan and I played Flappy Bird (a version I coded with the help of artificial intelligence). Just before bed, she asked to see 'the fox'. I wasn't sure what she meant, so I generated a fox for her.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*oPkhrFWMSzCjPEfnzxc_Kw.png)\n\nAnyways, a great day. Grateful for all my blessings. I was scrolling Craigslist the other day, as I mentioned in a recent Medium, yearning for more, when the reality is I have so much. Better to practice gratitude than to develop an attitude because you don't have what you want. The second I got something I wanted, the satisfaction would be fleeting, and I'd be on to the next desire, repeating. The best way to avoid that pain is to recognize the gain that comes from reminding ourselves we already have enough. That mindset shift is clutch. At least if you want to remain content with your present state, embrace what you appreciate, before it's too late.\n\n4/16/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
