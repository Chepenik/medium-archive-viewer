  "content": "# Day 1046\n\nMan what a great week it has been. Grateful it is a Friday and I get to go celebrate one of my best friend's engagements.\n\nTo sum up this week:\n\n- Got my first win as a flag football coach\n\n- Got airdropped a large sum of tokens I converted to cash for using an AI platform\n\n- Had some solid [shitposts on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/conorchepenik_roses-are-red-bitcoins-a-token-im-sorry-activity-7290421311145738240-y6uU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)\n\n- Finished Brave New World\n\n- Had a good week at work helping clients and bonding with teammates\n\n- Held off from buying a new Mac, but will see how long that lasts because I want to pull trigger and get a nice new Mac so I can run LLMs locally on my machineðŸ˜‚ \n\nNothing too crazy but it's nice to stop and smell the roses. I can't believe the first month of 2025 is already over. Kind of insane how fast it has flown by.\n\nAnyways, I'm going to go crack a beer, have a shower, and put on a suit because I got some partying to do.\n\nHere is to another great 11 monthsðŸ¥‚\n\nSee you tomorrow anon\n\n1/31/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
