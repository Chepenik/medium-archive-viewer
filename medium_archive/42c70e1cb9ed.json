  "content": "Day 612\n\nAfter Thanksgiving my family has a tradition of playing golf on Friday morning and poker at night. It's always such a blast getting to spend time with family and enjoy fun activities.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*NJKr9yuL2uf_pqReUy4iVw@2x.jpeg)\n\nOn top of that I got to meet with my high school buddies Gray & Travis today. Then I got to play pickleball with my Grandparents.\n\nMy writing has been lacking in substance because I've been busy enjoying these games with family. As a matter of fact I'm writing this now waiting to see who wins the poker tonight. I came in 8th (one spot outside the money) but that's alright. It was a blast playing. Also tied for first in golf but then lost in the playoffs.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*4OUJZnC4DOQwNXbsNGLfmw@2x.jpeg)\n\nNext year I'll get my title revenge. Need to get my name back on the family trophies.\n\nTradition is important. Feeling damn grateful my family has these traditions and I plan to keep them going. Also want to start the tradition of taking videos of family and putting them together my child(ren). Really excited about being able to email my daughter stuff. Hopefully email is not obsolete when she gets to the age where she can enjoy it ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£\n\nLife is short so don't lose sight of the things that matter.\n\n11/24/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
