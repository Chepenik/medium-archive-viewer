Won a basketball tournament, ate some cow meat, and had plenty of conversations I really appreciated.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1672703790334500864%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nDuring the event, I had the privilege of manning the front door and zapping people ten dollars worth of bitcoin so they could use it to buy stuff at the festival. Witnessing the ease with which bitcoin can be sent and received was truly astonishing. A big thank you to the diligent work of the developers building Wallet Of Satoshi. It is important to recognize Wallet Of Satoshi operates under a custodial model. Best practices include keeping smaller amounts of bitcoin in custodial wallets. Your main stack should probably leverage one of the many good hardware wallets out there. That said, Wallet Of Satoshi has completely killed the UX/UI game and sending bitcoin to strangers was seamless. Even if someone didn't have the app it was a super fast download and the user didn't have to do anything but click receive in order to get the bitcoin. I did my best to educate people about the tradeoffs with a custodial wallet and the importance of backing up your wallet. Luckily, I'm sure many spent the ten dollars worth of btc at the festival anyways.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/rounakskm/status/1672757333632471042%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nAt the festival I spoke with my buddy Joe today and we discussed how much social media has changed since its inception. From its humble beginnings as a text-based platform on mySpace to the thousands of social media platforms out there which have evolved into captivating applications that effortlessly offer us instant dopamine. However, the dopamine rush experienced from mindlessly scrolling through platforms like Twitter or TikTok tends to be less fulfilling compared to the genuine satisfaction derived from engaging in physical activities like running, where personal effort is required to earn it. Joe aptly pointed out that Twitter should be utilized as a means to build an audience rather than mindlessly consuming content. I resonated with his perspective and resolved to adopt a more mindful approach towards my social media usage.\n\nOne of the remarkable aspects I've observed during Bitcoin meetups, festivals, and various events is the depth and significance of the conversations held among participants. These discussions are not only enlightening but also hold profound meaning. Witnessing individuals connect and form bonds in person serves as a powerful reminder of the abundance of goodness present in the world. As we embark on the journey towards widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies like Nostr, it becomes crucial for us as a community to remain unwavering in our commitment to our principles, even in the face of challenges or setbacks. We must persist in collaborating harmoniously, providing mutual support, and actively spreading awareness about these transformative tools that possess the potential to revolutionize our world for the better.\n\nOne of the most inspiring moments of the festival was listening to Canadian Truckers share their reasons for standing up to tyranny. Their bravery and dedication to the cause of freedom in the face of adversity left a lasting impression on me. Witnessing the power of a small group of individuals, driven by the ideals of freedom, liberty, and sovereignty, is truly awe-inspiring. Using non-violent means the Truckers stood up to tyranny for everyone in the world.\n\nToday was such a great example of the unity fostered by Bitcoin. In the pursuit of freedom, we find the strength to overcome any obstacle we face together. Satoshi Nakamoto's introduction of Bitcoin on January 3, 2009, marked the beginning of a peaceful revolution. The impact of Bitcoin extends far beyond its monetary value. It represents a symbol of hope and empowerment, demonstrating that individuals can take a stand for their rights and forge a path towards freedom without resorting to violence. It is a testament to the power of innovation and decentralized networks, offering a beacon of light in a world where oppressive forces often loom large.\n\nAs we continue to advance in this peaceful revolution, let us remember the Canadian Truckers and countless others who courageously stand up against tyranny. By adopting Bitcoin and embracing the ideals of freedom and sovereignty, we can shape a future where peaceful resistance and financial empowerment prevail over oppression and violence. Together, we have the means to build a world where liberty and justice flourish for all.\n\nGod Bless America, God Bless The Truckers, God Bless Bitcoin, God Bless all the people out there working towards building a better future for our descendants.\n\nMassAdoption is happening. Come and witness it for yourselfâš¡ ðŸŸ \n\n6/24/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
