An effort that could pay off later on in life when these machines get even better at giving us what we want.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*5KNJ4qOl0tBiSG2Oqcnbow.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*KuxqiWEcDlL88gaQryYahQ.png)\n\nThought these two images of text tied in nicely with the zero to one piece I finally wrote.\n\n> [**0 to 1**](https://binmucker.substack.com/p/0-to-1?sd=pf)\n\nThere is a lot of joy in going 0 to 1 across various aspects of life. Sometimes we have to deal with disturbance in our life because these challenges will breed the best version of ourself. The version of us that creates more 0 to 1 moments in this beautiful universe :)\n\n7/28/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
