Go on a date night with my wife.\n\n4. Practice breathing exercises every day this week.\n\n5. Clear the back porch of all bricks and stones to prepare for pouring a new concrete pad with my father-in-law's help.\n\n6. Improve my Binmucker.com website with a fun game users can play while clicking around.\n\n7. Make 7 memes I post on X.com\n\nI should make more lists for my Medium posts.
