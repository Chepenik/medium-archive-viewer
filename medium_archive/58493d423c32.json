  "content": "# Day 639\n\nWe all wear masks as we go throughout our day. It's a weird thing to accept but it's true. When was the last time you acted completely like your true self?\n\nI don't know if I can answer that. Alone I guess? Hahahaha that sounds so weird to admit but it's liberating. Like anger, wearing masks might get a bad wrap but it's not a bad thing. Many humans would be turned off by each other if we just let our id run wild. Is the id the true self? I don't know.\n\nThe id is the primitive, instinctive part of the personality. It is entirely unconscious and operates on the \"pleasure principle,\" seeking immediate gratification of basic needs and desires such as hunger, thirst, sex, and aggression. The id has no concept of reality or morality, and it is driven by a need to reduce tension.\n\nThe ego, on the other hand, is the realistic part of the personality. It is partly conscious and partly unconscious, and it operates on the \"reality principle.\" The ego's job is to mediate between the id's demands and the external world. It must find ways to satisfy the id's needs in a way that is safe and acceptable. The ego also develops defense mechanisms to protect the individual from anxiety and distress.\n\nI believe that masks are us trying to decide what the right balance of our ego and id is in any situation. Most people will only ever reveal 100% of their id when they are alone or commiting henious acts. Thank God we have the ego to rein in our id when it starts acting out of line. Don't shy away from your primal nature but recognize we are animals who have a great capacity to selective choose the masks we wear to better our circumstances. Life is so beautiful: cherish it!\n\n12/21/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
