Aladdin, founder of Bitcoin Trading Cards, is no exception. He's been a disruptor long before he ever heard the word 'Bitcoin,' coming of age in the cannabis industry, deeply connected to the original \"mom and pops\" who first braved the front lines of legalization.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*vocP5FfOenHtEEsT)\n\n**Caption: Learn more at [https://btc-tc.com/](https://btc-tc.com/)**\n\n\"I grew up incredibly red-pilled thanks to my dad,\" Aladdin recalls, reflecting on his early life immersed in an industry built on challenging authority. \"I always wanted to do something anti-establishment, going against the grain, and definitely - you can't tell me what to do.\"\n\nBut as legalization brought big corporations flooding into cannabis, Aladdin sensed the coming collapse. \"Big business moved in, took over, and crushed the small operators,\" he explains. Watching the price of cannabis plummet from $5,000 per pound (bulk purchases) to barely $100 was enough for Aladdin to see the writing on the wall. It was time to pivot.\n\nBitcoin emerged into his life in 2016, precisely as he was wrapping up his cannabis ventures. The shift from cannabis to Bitcoin wasn't merely coincidental, it was intentional. Bitcoin represented everything that had drawn Aladdin into cannabis: decentralization, anti-authoritarianism, and freedom. Only this time, he saw a real chance to build something resilient against the tides of corporate greed.\n\n\"I saw what was coming for cannabis and tried to warn people. Nobody listened,\" he says. \"When I discovered Bitcoin, I wanted to shout from the rooftops: Bitcoin! Bitcoin! But nobody wanted to listen again.\"\n\nTo solve this, Aladdin tapped into a passion he had discovered in his cannabis days: trading cards. Having previously created educational cannabis trading cards detailing everything from growing conditions to lab results, he realized the same approach could revolutionize Bitcoin education.\n\n\"I'm not super technical,\" Aladdin admits with characteristic humility. \"But I studied my ass off about Bitcoin and trading cards. It took me four years to deeply understand what people needed to overcome their fears about Bitcoin.\"\n\nHis method was unconventional but effective - he began hosting meetups and rather than preaching, he simply listened. \"I asked them questions, figured out their fears and confusion, and turned those notes into Bitcoin Trading Cards.\"\n\nThese aren't ordinary cards. They are meticulously crafted, visually compelling, and educationally potent. Each card encapsulates key Bitcoin concepts, prominent Bitcoin figures, and freedom fighters who, in Aladdin's eyes, are crucial allies to Bitcoiners.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*8Z2ZiXq2T5F4llaf)\n\n**Caption: Shop these collections at [https://btc-tc.com/collections/all](https://btc-tc.com/collections/all)**\n\n\"You can't be a Bitcoiner and a commie,\" Aladdin laughs. \"Freedom fighters come first because, without freedom, Bitcoin can't thrive.\" While it's true the Bitcoin network is permissionless, allowing anyone to participate, Aladdin's emphasis on freedom remains crucial. Bitcoin's core value lies in its decentralization and the power it grants individuals to transact freely without intermediaries. Freedom fighters, who prioritize individual sovereignty over collectivist ideologies, play an essential role in safeguarding Bitcoin's decentralization by running nodes, home miners, and spreading best practices when people utilize Bitcoin in their lives; ensuring the network remains secure, open, and accessible for everyone.\n\nOne of Aladdin's first cards featured G. Edward Griffin, author of \"The Creature from Jekyll Island,\" whom Aladdin credits as one of his greatest red-pill influences. The collection rapidly expanded to include notable Bitcoiners like Adam Back and Tone Vays, along with a range of freedom activists.\n\nYet Aladdin advises caution as Bitcoin gains mainstream adoption. Reflecting on his experience in the cannabis industry, he sees similar risks for Bitcoin. \"All it takes is someone like Mr. Beast jumping fully into Bitcoin,\" he warns, \"and the original voices and pioneers could be overshadowed overnight by influencers who lack Bitcoin's core values and ethos.\" To counter this, he encourages active support of authentic Bitcoin advocates: \"Support your local Bitcoin OGs and educators. Retweet, comment, engage. It's free, and it makes a meaningful difference.\"\n\nBitcoin Trading Cards also stands firmly against the artificial scarcity rampant in traditional trading card markets. \"Pokemon and Topps print billions of cards - there's no true scarcity,\" he explains. \"We're here to shake up the hobby just like Bitcoin disrupted the monetary system, by introducing genuine scarcity and authentic value.\"\n\nDespite his entrepreneurial success, Aladdin remains grounded. He homeschools his children, emphasizing passion-driven learning and community engagement. \"The Citadel isn't a physical place; it's the community and relationships you build,\" he insists. Yet, Aladdin warns, \"Just because someone homeschools doesn't automatically mean they're good people.\" This caution applies equally in Bitcoin. Just because someone identifies as a Bitcoiner doesn't automatically grant them trustworthiness. The ethos remains consistent: don't just trust, always verify.\n\nIf Aladdin could ask Satoshi Nakamoto one question? It would reflect gratitude and curiosity about upbringing: \"What kind of parents raised someone so giving and creative?\" Perhaps, Satoshi was homeschooled too.\n\nIn a world where corporations eagerly encroach on grassroots movements, Aladdin's Bitcoin Trading Cards stand as vibrant, creative resistance. One offering an artistic revolution sparking curiosity and freedom, one card at a time.",
