  "content": "# Day 407\n\nI've been watching La Casa De Papel on Netflix. I like that it's in Spanish so I can pretend that watching tv is productive because I'm learning a new language ;D\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*BgsWlNk_lgXQFG79)\n\nIt makes sense that a show based on robbers would be called Money Heist, but I don't get why the person who translated the show to English didn't call it House Of Paper instead. There is no doubt La Casa De Papel has a better ring to it than House Of Paper. Lol I just don't think Money Heist is that much more creativeðŸ˜‚\n\nI've been enjoying a wide variety of podcasts lately and one thing I've gathered is that humans (most of us anyways) spend so much time focusing on money, when real value in our life is what we should be focused on instead. Money can make your life materially easier, but ultimately it is not the money that people want. It's the goods and services that the money can provide. With many of these goods & services though there are ways to obtain them outside of just using money.\n\nMake friendships. Spend your time doing things you enjoy. Form bonds. Seek to barter rather than use fiat rials. This is the way.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*NZmiDys9uDOh5zUU.jpg)\n\n5/2/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
