  "content": "# Creating Alpha Out Of Everyday Situations\n\nToday my buddy convinced me and his roommate to go toss the football outside and take a break from the video games we had been playing. It was 45 degrees and the grass was soaked but we all had an incredible time breathing some fresh air and getting sunlight. Considering the day before was barely over 2 degrees Fahrenheit 40+ felt pretty good. I actually slipped and got dirt all over my dress pants but it was well worth it. Taking the time to toss the football (or doing whatever else makes you feel like a child at heart again) is so worth it. So often on Bitcoin Twitter I see pleps associating Alpha with money and there is a good reason for this. Money is a tool allowing us to get time back and experience the things we want to experience. That said, Alpha can be delivered in a variety of ways. Whether that is telling your body to relax, go outside, or collaborate with you on a project Alpha doesn't have to be about a stock or crypto. While I try to convince others to learn about Bitcoin because I think a lot of Alpha can be made in the asset, life is much more than just a number in your Bitcoin wallet (or checking if you aren't convinced finite, permissionless, peer-to-peer money is better than USD shitcoin). So be grateful for the little things and share with other humans ways to increase their happiness outside of monetary investment opportunities; like a simple game of toss.\n\n1/18/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
