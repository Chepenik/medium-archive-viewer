  "content": "# Day 1201\n\nToday I did some wind sprints after a short 1.4 mile run. It felt great, especially because I took my shoes off and did them while touching grass. I'm trying to let my body work more naturally and I do notice a difference. It's a bit harder to jog naturally since the run is mostly on concrete, so I keep my shoes on for that, but I'm taking small steps toward change.\n\nI'm also loving outdoor the workout gym up here in Acworth, Georgia where my grandparents live. Nice to be able to hit some reps on it after the run.\n\nWhen I got back I worked on my Bitcoin coloring book some more. Nice to make some progress on that project. Few more small tweaks to make sure it all matches then I'm going to order my prototype.\n\nAnd honestly, it just feels good to be up here with family. Life is better with loved ones. Especially when you visit farmers markets with them and see a vendor that accepts Bitcoin.\n\nFunnily enough he even happened to be using the same wallet software I was. Amazing!\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1941517719356178709](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1941517719356178709)](https://miro.medium.com/1*xh9qgdoXpxyXPAn2ZCVaRA.png)\n\n7/5/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
