  "content": "# Day 400\n\nIsn't it funny how when we have something, it's underwhelming, but when we want something, it's all we can think about? The human experience is something else. We have these Ferraris for brains, but they're often hijacked by our reptilian bodies, which are driven by basic needs like hunger, sex, and sleep. We are constantly chasing after things that we think will make us happy, but once we get them, we're quickly bored and start looking for something else. It's a never-ending cycle. Eat, fuck, repeat: that's the name of the game. You do those things and you will pass your genes on most likely. Much biological success.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Rxbv5sAOdgfG6Al9.jpg)\n\nYou know it's so amazing with the internet I can literally communicate my random thoughts with pictures. The things that are allegedly worth ~1000 words.\n\nI'm not going to lie coding bootcamp has me feeling dumb. Thinking logically is not as easy as it sounds. I need to remember that it is very easy to overestimate what I can get done in a day and underestimate what I can get done in a year.\n\nOnwards we go. Grateful for the life the lord has given me. Ready to shitpost, grow, and become a better human. Slowly, surely, day by day. 400 mf days writing. LFG!\n\n4/26/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
