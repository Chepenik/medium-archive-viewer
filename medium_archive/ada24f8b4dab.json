  "content": "# Day 807\n\nAs I grow older, I realize there's little I value more than a good night's sleep. It's ironic how, as children, we fight against the very thing our parents try so hard to give us: a reasonable sleep schedule. Then, as adults, we often disrupt it with our jobs, responsibilities, and the lure of nightlife.\n\nLately, I've been putting my child to sleep, and it's a wonderful reminder to slow down. Cherish the small moments. Listen more. She's starting to talk, and I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to engage with her. I love the way a baby pronounces things.\n\nChildren are the best. They bring a joy that surpasses even the bliss of a great night's sleep.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*rHM9m4j7qhzA0ttP)\n\n6/6/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
