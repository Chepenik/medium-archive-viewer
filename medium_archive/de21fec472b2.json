  "content": "# Day 1007\n\nYou know what I've been contemplating? For 2025, what if the fitness challenge undertaken is posting a shirtless picture of myself on X every day? It seems like a great way to force myself to adopt healthier habits.\n\nIt would definitely be easy to roast my Dad bod. Honestly, I don't particularly want to do this challenge, but it feels like an effective way to stay motivated. The alternative is getting mocked online by strangers for posting pictures and not making any progress.\n\nYes, posting a picture with your shirt off is kind of gay. Not in the sexual orientation sense, but more in the way prepubescent boys use the word to describe things they don't like.\n\nThen again, maybe I just don't like shirtless pictures because I've never had a six-pack to post a good one. Maybe thinking shirtless pics are \"gay\" is just me projecting since I don't post them myself.\n\nI should do it. There are few better ways to hold yourself accountable than the internet. It's going to be a great 2025.\n\n12/23/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
