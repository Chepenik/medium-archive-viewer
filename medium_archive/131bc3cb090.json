This data says a lot.\n\n![[https://twitter.com/TheBlackHorse65/status/1674800284235603968?s=20](https://twitter.com/TheBlackHorse65/status/1674800284235603968?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*YKi3WSvPI9AEfR48yTgumQ.png)\n\nAlso Twitter has kind of been a shit show today and introduced limits to how many times you could view tweets. Odell has been pretty spot on about Twitter Blue being a trojan horse for digital ID. Maybe true maybe not true but I lean towards the former.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*T7HDqPLqY0EX8D8rhvKZ0g.png)\n\nWonder if this has anything to do with it? Potentially.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*C5TYtH7mK6zavyPD)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*6-LO1DZZyk_t-XdO)\n\nInteresting summer. I need to stop spending so much time online and smell the roses. It has been so special being back in Jax seeing my family. Cyber space is mid. Real life is where the real value can be found :)\n\n7/1/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
