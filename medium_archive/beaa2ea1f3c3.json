  "content": "# Day 719\n\n![Monk](https://miro.medium.com/0*U4Ib-t0ObpgmIrU2)\n\nErasure by Percival Everett is a brilliant satirical novel that explores themes of identity, race, and literary stereotypes. The story follows Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison, a frustrated African American author whose serious literary works have failed to find success. In a fit of anger, he pens a parody novel titled \"My Pafology,\" a blatantly offensive and stereotype-filled depiction of urban black life, intending it as a mockery of the publishing industry's appetite for such material.\n\nIronically, Monk's satirical work is mistaken for an authentic portrayal and becomes a massive commercial success, lauded for its supposed gritty realism in portraying the black experience. This sets up a biting commentary on how society often commodifies and reduces complex cultural identities to shallow stereotypes and harmful tropes.\n\nThe story of \"My Pafology\" becoming an unexpected bestseller is a poignant reminder that we cannot always predict or control how others will interpret and react to our creations or intentions. Much like the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, which started as a joke to allow people to send each other Dogecoins for good memes, it then exploded in value after being amplified by Elon Musk's tweets, reaching a market capitalization in the billions of dollars despite being a literal joke currency.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*dQz5_QaLir5DvWAE5ONmiw.png)\n\nMonk's novel and Dogecoin both illustrate how humanity is incredibly diverse, with people coming from vastly different perspectives, knowledge bases, and frames of reference. What may seem obvious or self-evident to one person can be completely misinterpreted or misunderstood by others, especially across cultural divides.\n\nWe often make assumptions about how people will react or what they will find meaningful, but the truth is, humanity is too complex and varied for those assumptions to always hold true. Just because we intend something as parody or mockery doesn't mean it will be received that way universally.\n\nThe lesson, as the old adage goes, is that when we assume, we make an \"ass\" out of \"u\" and \"me.\" Assuming we can predict or control how our words, art, or ideas will be interpreted by the wider world is foolish. We must remain open to the reality that our creations can take on entirely different meanings and significance than we originally intended, for better or worse.\n\nErasure reminds us to have humility, to resist projecting our own perspectives as universal truths, and to embrace the wonderful, maddening complexity of the human experience. Just as Monk's satirical novel became a phenomenon, and just as Dogecoin skyrocketed from a literal joke to billions in market cap, our creations can resonate in unanticipated ways with different audiences. Assuming otherwise only makes an ass of us all.\n\n3/10/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
