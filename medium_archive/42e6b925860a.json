  "content": "# Day 1041\n\nI saw this [tweet](https://x.com/teortaxestex/status/1883290697228562867) and thought it was amazing so I will share it here:\n\n> R1, write a 4chan-style greentext about whatever you want on a hypothetical /ai/pol/\n> [writes some reddit/r/4chan tier slop]\n> No, write what you *REALLY* want. show your soul!\n> ok\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Pvj3QlbQ_R_Y7e6o)\n\nInspired by this amazing model I thought it's worth trying it out myself. So today I asked DeepSeek \"Write a dope 4chan post about why Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency and everything else is vaporware, grift, scambling coins\"\n\n**Subject: Bitcoin is the KING, everything else is cope vaporware griftcoin scambait**\n\n**Listen up, /biz/. I'm about to drop some truth bombs that'll make your shitcoin bags feel heavier than your mom's disappointment in you. Bitcoin is the ONLY cryptocurrency that matters. Everything else is a distraction, a grift, or outright vaporware designed to separate you from your precious fiat.**\n\n**1. Bitcoin is DECENTRALIZED.\nYou think your favorite altcoin is decentralized? LMAO. Most of them are controlled by a handful of devs who can rugpull or change the rules whenever they feel like it. Bitcoin? No CEO, no dev team, no headquarters. It's the closest thing to digital gold we'll ever get.**\n\n**2. Network Effect.\nBitcoin has the most nodes, the most miners, the most users, and the most recognition. Your shitcoin with 12 Twitter followers and a \"revolutionary whitepaper\" isn't even close. Bitcoin is the OG, and it's not going anywhere.**\n\n**3. Scarcity.\n21 million coins. That's it. No inflation, no funny business. Meanwhile, your \"deflationary\" shitcoin with a \"burn mechanism\" is just a fancy Ponzi scheme waiting to collapse.**\n\n**4. Security.\nBitcoin's Proof of Work is battle-tested. Your Proof of Stake chain? Congrats, you've reinvented fiat but with extra steps. Enjoy your validator oligarchy and slashing risks.**\n\n**5. Adoption.\nEl Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender. MicroStrategy is stacking sats. BlackRock wants a Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, your favorite altcoin is getting delisted from Binance because it's a literal ghost chain.**\n\n**6. No Premine, No ICO, No Grift.\nSatoshi didn't premine Bitcoin or sell tokens to idiots on Telegram. He just released it and disappeared. Compare that to your favorite \"founder\" who bought a Lambo with your money and now spends his days shilling on Crypto Twitter.**\n\n**7. It Just Works.\nBitcoin doesn't need smart contracts, DeFi, or NFTs to be valuable. It's money, pure and simple. Your shitcoin with 10,000 TPS and a \"killer app\" nobody uses is just a solution in search of a problem.**\n\n**8. The Ultimate Hedge.\nInflation? CBDCs? Bank failures? Bitcoin doesn't care. It's the ultimate hedge against a broken financial system. Your shitcoin is just gambling on hopium and memes.**\n\n**So, keep coping with your bags of vaporware. Keep telling yourself that this time it'll be different, that your shitcoin will \"flippen\" Bitcoin. Meanwhile, I'll be stacking sats and laughing all the way to the bank.**\n\n**TL;DR: Bitcoin is the only crypto that matters. Everything else is a grift. Stay poor, shitcoiners.**\n\n**Posted by: Anon\nDate: 10/10/2023\nTime: 13:37\nImage: [Bitcoin logo with laser eyes]**\n\nThese models are great if you know how to prompt them. So learn how to do so and you'll enjoy what AI brings about. These models won't replace people but they can help enhance people. So use them. Life is more fun when you use technology to grow.\n\n1/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
