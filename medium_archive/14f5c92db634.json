I'd love to read every book out there - the good, the bad, and the \"how did this get published?\" Sure, the good ones nourish the mind, but the bad ones? They make you appreciate the good ones even more or at least provide a good chuckle.\n\nI want to watch every YouTube video ever uploaded, but let's be real - even if I lived forever, more content gets uploaded in a day than I could watch in a year. It's like trying to drink from a fire hose connected to the ocean.\n\nI want to visit every city in the world, but maybe I should start with every city in the USA. Life is finite - that's what makes it so valuable.\n\nSo here's to figuring out what's truly worth our time, making the most of the short stint we have on this spinning rock.\n\nWith only ~**700,000 hours** in your life it is worth trying to make those hours count!\n\n11/1/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
