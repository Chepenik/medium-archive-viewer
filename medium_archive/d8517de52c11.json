  "content": "# Day 658\n\nToday the SEC announced the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF only to have Gary Gensler claim it was a false alarm. Needless to say it was a wild day on Bitcoin Twitter.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/WalkerAmerica/status/1744849365439569981%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI would not put it past the SEC having someone on the inside do this to try and make a claim tomorrow that this proves market manipulation so they ca hold off on approving a Bitcoin ETF. I don't think that will happen but never say never. I also would not be surprised if that organization is just incompetent and got hacked. Which is insane to think that the SEC is the organization tasked with policing markets and they can't even use 2FA to prevent getting hacked but here we are.\n\nThis is what Bitcoin did on the news. Talk about a fake outðŸ’€\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*6exq3hJE3Gm2hjv60-M6qw.png)\n\nIf it was hackers I hope they were able to trade the news quickly. Honestly wild to think how much money can be made or lost based on some tweets. Pretty incredible to realize how fast information moves in a digital world.\n\nEither way I will look forward to what they decide to do tomorrow. This meme cracked me up.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Y_OULokPApHvTX8a.jpg)\n\n1/9/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
