A perfect mix of humor and insight. These honest truths would not have hit so hard had they not come from a stand-up comedian. Comedy is based in truth and it's a way for people to express things and get others to listen who otherwise would not listen. So well done Sam Hyde. Bravo üëè\n\nAnyways, another 365 days down. Here is to a great 2025.\n\n12/31/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
