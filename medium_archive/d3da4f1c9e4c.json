It was delicious and I'm so lucky for these blessings in my life.\n\nAfterwards when I got home and went to put my kid to bed I said a prayer tonight with her. The way she smiled, said Jesus Christ and amen were beautiful. Talk about bringing joy into your heart. It's worth showing your children how to pray. They are little balls of energy that follow exactly what you do. So teach them to do worthwhile stuff and you will raise quality kids.\n\nEasier said than done of course, but to accomplish great things one must overcome adversity. Such is life.\n\n1/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
