What an interview that I'm sure people will be talking about for decades.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/DavidBCollum/status/1756166186054701064%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis is a fitting tweet. In said interview Putin alluded to the fact that Tucker wanted to work for the CIA but was rejected. Anons on Twitter claimed he was never truly \"rejected\".\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/JolyonKlebold/status/1755773765764452410%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI don't know the truth, but I know this fit goes hard. Would love to have those New Balances and that jacket.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*P6gVaVfZ3Mb642zE)\n\nIn the interview I appreciated Putin advocating for the 'de-nazification' of Ukraine, ostensibly to justify his aggressive policies towards the country. I'm not sure how big the Azov Battalion's role as a legitimate component of Ukraine's defense forces is. That said, it is still crazy there is a Nazi problem in Ukraine at all and we are funding them.\n\nTopics like this are hard. People get heated but nothing is ever so black or white. However, I truly believe that if World War 3 is avoided it will be in part because Tucker went and started a dialogue with a world leader who, is a former KGB spy so maybe take this next part with a grain of salt, but genuinely seems to want peace with the West.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1756010454206345430%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nWe can learn so much more from our enemies than our friends. Enemies don't sugar coat the bullshit for brownie points. Friends thoðŸ‘€ . Yea friends do that shit!\n\n2/9/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
