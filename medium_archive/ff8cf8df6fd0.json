Here are some tweets to summarize what I've been consuming and thinking about.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1726072839080427871%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/mattturck/status/1726017399176999196%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3D4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis weekend has been quite eventful for the AI industry. While I have many reservations about Sam's Worldcoin project, I must commend him and his team for their remarkable contributions to the AI field through OpenAI. Their dedication to innovation and progress is truly inspiring, and I hope they can find a way to overcome the current challenges and continue delivering groundbreaking work. Like everyone else, I'm eagerly awaiting to see what unfolds next. Witnessing these developments firsthand has also prompted me to reflect on news consumption habits in general.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1725944560398856626?s=20](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1725944560398856626?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*J6guxPWVqyfVFI1w_MOniQ.png)\n\nIn other news (pun intended ðŸ˜‰ ), while enjoying some family time tonight, the contentious Israel-Palestine conflict surfaced in debate. Before weighing in deeply, I want to stress my desire to see innocent lives spared on both sides. It's a complex issue where nuance is easily lost amidst war's chaos. In the lively discussion tonight, I advocated for urgent priorities like protecting civilians and freeing hostages of all nationalities to enable a ceasefire. To gain more background, I asked a GPT to scroll the web and give me a nuanced take on the Israel-Palestine conflict. While somewhat informative, true understanding requires ongoing open-minded learning. At this stage, I still have many blindspots and probably always will because the United States is and always will be the country I care most about. The USA is my homeland and I want it to thrive.\n\nThat said, the U.S has allies and I want to better understand what is going on in the world. So if I miss something or this GPT summary is not on point in some ways please use the comments to broaden my knowledge. More perspectives are welcomed. I do believe with time and good faith effort humanities shared understanding of the nuance in this situation could inch us closer to peace.\n\n> The Israel-Palestine conflict, deeply rooted in a century-old colonial act, remains one of the world's most complex and enduring conflicts. It has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions. Recent developments as of November 2023 reveal a continued escalation in violence and humanitarian crises, particularly in the Gaza Strip.\n\n> Historically, the conflict's origins trace back over 100 years to the Balfour Declaration in 1917, wherein Britain promised the establishment of a national home for Jewish people in Palestine, then predominantly inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. This promise, followed by British Mandate rule and mass Jewish immigration, significantly altered the region's demographics and ignited tensions. The Arab Revolt of 1936â€“1939, sparked by protests against British colonialism and Jewish immigration, was brutally suppressed by British forces, setting a precedent for future conflictsâ€‹â€‹.\n\n> The situation further escalated with the United Nations' 1947 Partition Plan, which proposed dividing Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. The plan was rejected by Palestinians, as it allotted a majority of the land to the Jewish state despite Palestinians owning 94% of the land and making up 67% of the population. Following the expiration of the British Mandate in 1948, the Zionist movement, aiming to establish a Jewish state, embarked on military operations against Palestinian towns and villages. This led to the Nakba (catastrophe), where over 500 Palestinian locations were destroyed, around 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, and Israel was established. Subsequent wars and the 1967 occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, and other territories led to further displacement and conflictâ€‹â€‹.\n\n> Recent events, as of November 2023, indicate a war between Israel and Hamas has entered its sixth week. The Israeli military's actions, including air raids and a blockade on Gaza, have led to significant Palestinian casualties and infrastructural damages. The United Nations Security Council passed a Malta-sponsored resolution for \"humanitarian pauses\" in Gaza, and international responses have varied, with some leaders condemning Israel's actions. The humanitarian impact is severe, with hospitals like al-Shifa under attack, only a few operational hospitals in northern Gaza, and difficulties in providing medical care due to the siegeâ€‹â€‹.\n\n> In summary, the Israel-Palestine conflict is characterized by deep historical roots, ongoing political and territorial disputes, and significant humanitarian crises. The conflict remains unresolved, with recent escalations further complicating prospects for peace and stability in the region.\n\nWar sucks. Innocent men my age are dying fighting on behalf of old farts who think they are justified attacking the other side. It sounds stupid to just say Oh mEh BiTcOiN FiXeS tHIs. However, I do believe that many conflicts simply would not be possible if nation-states could not create money out of thin air to finance these conflicts. Of course even if nation-states did not have money printers this war would still likely continue. There is clearly a rich history here. I just believe that the war would be shortened and humanity would be better off in the long term if we can find a way to remove the money printer from the hands of government. Hence I advocate for a monetary sytem like Bitcoin to replace the current fiat system which can fund war even when these wars are highly unprofitable.\n\nHere's to the hope for reconciliation between Israel and Palestine. It's a challenging situation, and my thoughts are with all those affected. I pray for a peaceful resolution and an end to civilian casualties. I'm thankful that my family and I are not directly involved in this conflict. Despite the current challenges, I remain hopeful for peace. War is undoubtedly complex, but I believe in humanity's capacity to ultimately make the right choices. We can't let our emotions get the best of us. We must ask the tough questions, lower our time preference, and think critically every dayðŸ«¡\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*f3ZzOwuqtdBH2R9q)\n\n11/18/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
