  "content": "# Living Life With Purpose\n\nWhen you find something you're passionate about it's much easier to get in a \"flow state\". Spending time doing things that excite you make it so you don't even think about your worries. A great example is playing sports. In the middle of a pickup basketball game I'm not thinking about bills, relationships, or any of the other things I have to deal with as a human being living in modern-day society. I just lock in and enjoy the task at hand. Sports have been great for my mental health, my physical health, and have allowed me to form some powerful friendships.\n\nPart of me is afraid to leave my current role because I'm making enough to support myself and invest the extra amount in Bitcoin. The problem is I don't wake up excited to do my job. I want to wake up and know I'm likely to enter a flow state when I start really digging into my work. Writing, reading, exercising, and cooking have all become activities I do that benefit my health in numerous ways and allow me to enter a flow state. Also, listening to any Bitcoin-related contentðŸ¤£. While I love my employer and co-workers I don't get this sense of excitement from my current job. TBD what I decide to do, but in the meantime, I will continue to prioritize activities I love and cut back on tasks that make me feel like there is no point to this incredible gift we call life.\n\n12/27/21\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
