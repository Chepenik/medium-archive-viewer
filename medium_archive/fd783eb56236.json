  "content": "# Day 1133\n\n**What Do People Regret On Their Death Bed?**\n\nOne day, all the noise falls away.\n The pings. The notifications. The endless little to-do lists.\n And what's left... is you.\n\nI wonder if, in the future, one of the big regrets will be _using AI too much._\n Or maybe just letting _technology in general_ run too much of life.\n Trading wonder for convenience. Trading the real for the easy.\n\nBut I don't think that's the main regret.\n If I had to guess, the real regret is this:\n **Not living life on your own damn terms.**\n\nNot looking inward long enough to figure out what you _actually_ want.\nNot noticing how rare you are. How strange. How irreplaceable.\nNot treating yourself like a miracle.\n\nSleepwalking through years you can't get back.\nLetting other people's opinions build the walls of your life.\nForging chains with your own hands - and calling it being \"responsible.\"\n\nAnother regret?\n**Not forgiving.**\nCarrying hate like it's some kind of shield.\nWhen all it really does is eat you from the inside.\n\nPeople are weird.\nPeople are messy.\nYou'll never know the full weight of what someone else is dragging behind them. And you don't have to.\n\nLet go anyway.\nForgive anyway.\nNot because they deserve it , but because _you_ do.\n\nWe live in a fallen world.\n But God, in His mercy, forgave us anyway.\n None of us are worthy.\n And yet, Jesus bore it all, so we could rise.\n\nIf He forgave the unforgivable...\nWhat excuse do we have?\n\nThe truth is brutal, but it's also freeing:\nIt all ends faster than you think.\nFaster than you're ready for.\nFaster than you can bargain with.\n\nListen to yourself.\nBe gentle with yourself.\nMove with urgency, not panic.\nAnd whatever you do: **wake up**.\n\nYou weren't made to be a background character.\n You were made to live, to fight, to burn brightly! \nJust think, you are the only soul like yours this world will ever know.\n\nDon't waste it.\n\n4/28/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
