  "content": "# Day 426\n\nToday I put up a youtube tutorial to help people build a personal website and sell their goods and services with magic webstore. It's kind of the freemuim model. If someone has the technical capibilities to pull down code from github and make tweaks then they are good to go. However if they need some help they can purchase my web development skills.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FyHSx-Bg8xqI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyHSx-Bg8xqI&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FyHSx-Bg8xqI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nFeels good to create content which I believe can be valuable for many. I need to focus more on stuff like this. Provide value then if others find it valuable they will return the favor.\n\nI've been making some progress on Habit-Chain which is nice to see. Here is what it currently looks like when you click on a specific habit.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*2BwAcWyhpoki-aGg8c6kEQ.png)\n\nI've still got tons of work to do but it feels good to see my habits visualized on a page and have them connected with a chain logo. One thing I'm going to focus on is how to get these habits to display as either daily, weekly, or monthly and if the user doesn't click that button then the streak becomes inactive. Meaning they have to start a new one since they lost their streak. Once that is set up I have my work cut out for me trying to figure out how to set up an escrow with lightning. That way a user can put a desired amount and if they complete the habit streak goal they keep their funds and if they don't then it gets sent to whatever charity's wallet who they entered when they set up a habit streak challenge. I'm not sure how to set up lightning to do this yet, but I know it can be done. Here is to learning :)!\n\n5/22/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
