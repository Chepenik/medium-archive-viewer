  "content": "# Day 564\n\n**A Declaration For Sovereign Individuals In The Digital Age**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis Constitution is a bold experiment in liberty, designed to protect individual rights and local self-governance for all time. We recognize that fiat decrees alone are insufficient to prevent the centralization of power, so we have focused on aligning incentives to thwart any corrupting influence on our leaders. We, the people of the world, unite behind this charter to nurture our core values and safeguard its principles for millennia. May it secure the blessings of independence and self-determination for all.\n\n**Preamble**\n\nWe, the citizens of Earth, recognize our inalienable natural rights and commit to the enduring principles of peace, freedom, justice, entrepreneurship, and prosperity. We establish this Constitution of Consent to safeguard these principles for all, both present and future. By aligning incentives to prevent the accumulation and abuse of power, we ensure that the flame of liberty burns brightly for millennia to come. We will achieve this by using technology as a tool to liberate humanity rather than to control it.\n\n**Article I: Fundamental Rights**\n\nAll individuals are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty, private property, privacy, and the pursuit of their own self-interest. These rights are sacrosanct and constitute the cornerstone of a free society, protected from encroachment by any entity, be it the government or any other. However, these fundamental liberties are coupled with a profound responsibility: the obligation to respect the private property of others, refraining from any violation without their explicit consent.\n\nThe government's foremost duty is to safeguard these rights, intervening only when necessary to prevent harm to others. Such intervention is warranted solely when individual actions present a clear and immediate threat to the rights and safety of others.\n\nFurthermore, our society upholds the principle of equality under the law. Every individual, regardless of their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or any other attribute, shall be treated with equal respect and dignity by the government in all public matters. Discrimination on any basis is strictly prohibited, reaffirming our commitment to justice and fairness in the public sphere.\n\nHowever, we also recognize the importance of individual freedom in private matters. In the realm of personal associations and relationships, individuals have the right to associate freely with whomever they choose, in accordance with their personal beliefs and preferences. This recognition ensures that individuals retain their autonomy in private interactions, while public institutions remain committed to upholding the principles of fairness and non-discrimination in the broader society.\n\nIn the spirit of promoting a robust and open society, freedom of speech, press, assembly, and petition shall not be impeded. These rights are essential for the free exchange of ideas, the pursuit of knowledge, and the peaceful expression of dissent. They ensure that every citizen has a voice and a platform to advocate for their beliefs, contributing to the vibrant tapestry of our pluralistic society.\n\nBy recognizing and upholding these fundamental rights, we establish a society where individual liberties are cherished, government power is limited, and all citizens are equal before the law. These principles are the cornerstone of our commitment to justice, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness for every member of our society, both in public and private life.\n\nBy enshrining these natural rights and liberties as inviolable, we set forth a society founded on the principles of individual sovereignty, limited governance, and equality before the law. Article I of this Constitution affirms our dedication to empowering all people to freely pursue their own values and vision of the good life, unrestrained by arbitrary authority. We hold these truths to be self-evident: that the intrinsic worth and dignity of each person shall be respected, that independence and self-determination are the right of all, and that a just society can only flourish when individuals are at liberty to live their lives as they see fit, unencumbered by coercion or tyranny. This charter stands as a bulwark against totalitarianism and oppression, securing for all citizens the blessings of liberty for generations to come.\n\n**Article II: Limited Government**\n\nIn our vision of governance, government power is a meticulously crafted tool designed to serve the best interests of the people. It is to be wielded with the utmost restraint, guided by the fundamental principle of limiting government authority to the bare essentials required for safeguarding individual rights and the well-being of our society.\n\nThe foremost duty of the government is to secure and defend the inherent rights of each and every individual, including the rights to life, liberty, private property, privacy, and the pursuit of self-interest. Government intrusion into the lives of citizens is only justifiable when it is imperative to prevent harm or the violation of these sacred rights. This limitation ensures that the government's influence remains minimal, safeguarding the inviolable freedoms of our citizens.\n\nFurthermore, our constitution unequivocally forbids the creation of laws that confer special privileges or exemptions upon government officials or any particular group within our society. The rule of law stands as the great equalizer, applying without exception or favoritism. This steadfast commitment guarantees that no individual or faction can claim exemption from the law, and it ensures that justice remains impartial, examining each case solely on its merits.\n\nTransparency and accountability serve as the bedrock principles of our limited government. Every government action, decision, and expenditure must be carried out openly and made readily accessible to the public. This commitment to transparency empowers citizens with the information they require to hold their government accountable for its deeds. Government officials are duty-bound to elucidate and justify their actions to the very people they serve.\n\nMoreover, we wholeheartedly recognize the indispensable role of an informed citizenry in preserving the principles of limited government. A well-informed populace stands as the bulwark of our constitutional order, responsible for the oversight of government officials and their actions. In the absence of secrecy and obfuscation, citizens are enabled to fulfill their civic duty and actively participate in the democratic process.\n\nIn addition to these principles, our tax system adheres to the following:\n\n1. Limited Taxation: The government imposes only two types of taxes - a 1% sales tax for businesses and their sales (excluding individuals trading), and a 1% tax on property.\n\n2. Local Legislation: Those who pay the 1% property taxes have the authority to enact laws but require approval from all other property taxpayers in their jurisdiction.\n\n3. Bitcoin Payment: The government may request taxes to be paid in bitcoin, as we believe that the money chosen by society naturally is the best form of money. Just as gold was initially chosen by the free market, we look to the digital age, where bitcoin shows immense promise as a form of money that the free market will choose. By accepting bitcoin, the government positions itself powerfully to uphold its responsibilities.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that people retain the freedom to trade with the money of their choice. The government will never mandate any specific form of money or enact legal tender laws, respecting the natural choices made by society.\n\nIn summary, our dedication to limited government is founded upon the conviction that the authority of the state should be judiciously employed and always with the utmost reverence for individual rights. Our government exists primarily to shield and uphold these rights, abstaining from unwarranted intrusion into the lives and affairs of its citizens. Through a steadfast commitment to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law, we ensure that government power remains a servant of the people rather than their master, thereby upholding the cherished principles of liberty and justice upon which our nation was built.\n\n**Article III: Prohibition of Cronyism**\n\nIn our constitutional framework, we hold the principle of free markets as a cornerstone of our economic system. We affirm the fundamental right of individuals to own property, engage in trade, start businesses, and innovate without unwarranted interference from the government or any external entity. The bedrock of our economic philosophy is the promotion and protection of open and competitive markets.\n\nIndividuals are granted the freedom to own and manage their property as they see fit, whether it be real estate, businesses, or personal possessions. This property rights guarantee empowers individuals to make decisions about their resources and investments based on their own interests and values.\n\nWe recognize that open and competitive markets are essential for economic vitality and innovation. Therefore, it is the duty of the government to foster an environment where competition thrives. Monopolistic practices, collusion, and any form of anticompetitive behavior are strictly prohibited.\n\nTo underscore our unwavering commitment to preventing cronyism and preserving the integrity of our free markets, we institute severe consequences for government officials and businesses engaged in such activities. Any government official found guilty of colluding with private businesses for personal gain shall face a minimum sentence of ten years in prison, immediate removal from office, and forfeiture of all government benefits and pensions.\n\nBusinesses involved in cronyism shall be shut down, their assets seized, and their executives prosecuted. In cases of severe and deliberate collusion, where the harm to the public and the economy is egregious, individuals involved may face life imprisonment or the death penalty, as determined by the due process of law.\n\nCronyism, defined as any undue collaboration or favoritism between government and business entities, is unequivocally forbidden. Our constitution establishes a clear separation between the government and the private sector to prevent the concentration of power and the distortion of market forces. Public officials and government agencies are barred from extending special privileges or advantages to any business or individual.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to free markets extends to protecting property rights, intellectual property, and contracts. These protections ensure that individuals and businesses can invest, innovate, and engage in transactions with confidence, knowing that their rights and agreements are legally upheld.\n\nIn essence, our dedication to free markets is rooted in the belief that economic freedom and competition are essential for individual prosperity, innovation, and economic growth. Through this constitutional principle, we seek to create an environment where individuals are free to pursue their economic interests, where businesses thrive based on merit, and where the government's role is limited to safeguarding the integrity of the market and protecting the rights of its citizens. We consider any act of cronyism to be a grave offense against the principles of justice and the well-being of our society, and those convicted of such acts shall be held as traitors of our state.\n\n**Article IV: Technology and Privacy**\n\nIn our constitutional framework, we recognize the paramount importance of safeguarding the rights of individuals in an era of advancing technology. We affirm the unalienable right of individuals to utilize technology for peaceful and lawful purposes. Moreover, we hold privacy in personal data, communications, and devices as sacrosanct.\n\n**4.1: Right to Technological Freedom**\n\n**4.1.1 Technological Freedom:** Every individual possesses the inherent right to utilize technology freely for peaceful and lawful purposes. This right includes the ability to access, use, and innovate with technological tools and resources without undue interference or restriction.\n\n**4.1.2 Innovation and Progress:** In our society, we champion technological innovation and progress as catalysts for a brighter future. We wholeheartedly encourage individuals, businesses, and organizations to actively participate in advancing technology for the collective betterment of our society. Technology, in our view, is a powerful instrument capable of generating abundance for all, and we are dedicated to assisting individuals in fostering and harnessing these tools to their fullest potential.\n\n**4.2:** Privacy Protection\n\n**4.2.1** Privacy Rights: Privacy in personal data, communications, and devices shall be held inviolable. Individuals have the inherent right to control access to their personal information, safeguard their communications, and maintain the security of their devices.\n\n**4.2.2** Surveillance Restrictions: Surveillance conducted by government agencies or any other entities shall only be permissible with specific warrants obtained through due process of law. These warrants must demonstrate probable cause and adhere to strict legal standards. Unauthorized and unwarranted surveillance is strictly prohibited. Violations of this law will be considered treasonous just like cronyism.\n\n**4.3: Safeguarding Personal Privacy**\n\n**4.3.1. Scope of Prohibition:** Within our jurisdiction, the use of technologies, systems, or devices intended for or capable of invasive surveillance, which encroach upon personal privacy, violate the principles of due process, or facilitate widespread and indiscriminate data collection, is strictly prohibited.\n\n**4.3.2. Definition of Invasive Surveillance:** Invasive surveillance technologies encompass tools or practices that infringe upon an individual's right to privacy. These include unauthorized data collection, monitoring, or tracking of personal information without explicit and informed consent from the individuals affected.\n\n**4.3.3. Ethical and Lawful Usage:** This prohibition does not encompass technologies commonly used in our society, such as smartphones and computers, when employed for ethical and lawful purposes consistent with established legal frameworks and respect for individual privacy rights.\n\nThrough this constitutional article, we affirm our commitment to striking a delicate balance between technological advancement and individual privacy. We acknowledge that technology can empower individuals, enhance our lives, and foster progress, but it also has the potential to intrude upon our personal liberties.\n\nWe enshrine the right to technological freedom, emphasizing that individuals should be free to explore, create, and utilize technology without unwarranted restrictions. Moreover, we uphold the sanctity of privacy, recognizing that personal data, communications, and devices are extensions of an individual's private domain.\n\nOur stance on surveillance underscores the importance of due process and accountability. Surveillance may only be conducted when it is warranted by specific circumstances and approved through established legal procedures.\n\nBy strictly prohibiting technologies that enable mass surveillance, we reaffirm our commitment to protecting the privacy and civil liberties of our citizens. We believe that a society where technology and privacy coexist harmoniously is one where individuals can fully enjoy the benefits of technological progress while retaining their fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\n**V. Empowering Local Governance & Strengthening Communities**\n\nIn our unwavering commitment to a government that truly serves its citizens, we wholeheartedly embrace the principle of decentralized governance. We firmly believe that the authority of government should be brought as close to the people as feasibly possible, granting local communities the autonomy to forge their destinies, provided they uphold the fundamental rights of every individual.\n\nWithin this framework, any individual who owns property and dutifully pays the 1% yearly tax is empowered to propose amendments to the governing laws of their community. However, a critical condition for such amendments is the unanimous consent of all residents within that jurisdiction. This requirement is rooted in our desire to align incentives, ensuring that those proposing laws are deeply vested in maintaining the prosperity of their community. This consensus-based approach guarantees that every member of the community willingly consents to the laws that govern their lives.\n\nOur vision for governance is firmly anchored in the principles of local control, experimentation, and innovation. We prioritize these principles over central planning and excessive regulation, recognizing that the vitality and progress of our communities thrive best when driven by the collective wisdom and aspirations of their residents.\n\n**5.1 Decentralization of Power**\n\n**5.1.1. Empowering Local Communities:** We recognize that local communities possess unique insights into their needs, preferences, and values. Therefore, we advocate for the decentralization of government power, enabling communities to make decisions that directly impact their residents.\n\n**5.1.2. Respect for Individual Rights:** While local governance is encouraged, it is imperative that such autonomy does not infringe upon the fundamental rights of individuals. Every citizen's rights, as outlined in Article I, shall remain inviolable, regardless of the level of government.\n\n**5.2 Local Control and Innovation**\n\n**5.2.1. Freedom to Govern:** Local communities have the freedom to govern themselves in ways that align with their specific aspirations and values. This freedom extends to matters of policy, public services, and community development.\n\n**5.2.2. Experimentation and Innovation:** We champion the spirit of experimentation and innovation at the local level. Communities are encouraged to explore new approaches to governance, fostering a dynamic environment where successful solutions can be shared and replicated.\n\n**5.3 Minimal Centralization**\n\n**5.3.1. Limiting Centralization:** While local governance is at the core of our principles, we understand that certain issues may necessitate centralized coordination. However, such centralization shall be minimal, with the focus remaining on empowering local communities.\n\n**5.3.2. Balancing Interests:** In cases where the interests of multiple communities intersect, our constitution ensures a framework for cooperation and conflict resolution that respects the autonomy of each community involved. Decisions must be reached through consensus among the involved communities, with local representatives facilitating discussions and negotiations. Transparency, public participation, and respect for individual rights are paramount throughout the process, ensuring that the autonomy of each community is upheld.\n\nBy promoting decentralized governance, we aim to enhance the democratic process, encourage local innovation, and preserve the diverse tapestry of our nation. This approach allows for a more responsive government that respects the unique character of each community while upholding the rights and freedoms of every individual.\n\n**Article VI: Adaptive Constitution**\n\nOur Constitution is a dynamic and resilient foundation, designed to adapt to the evolving needs of our society. Amendments will only be considered when unanimous consensus among residents is achieved, ensuring that no change is made without the full consent of those who live within the jurisdiction. We envision a government structured solely to serve the interests of its constituents. We place a premium on extensive public involvement in the governance process, harnessing technology to prevent the unwarranted accumulation of power in any sphere of our society. Just as innovation drives the cost of goods towards marginal production costs, we aspire to a government that becomes progressively less relevant as innovation fosters abundance and prosperity.\n\n**Article VII: Consent of the Governed**\n\nThe legitimate authority of government stems from the explicit consent of its citizens. No law shall be binding on any individual without their voluntary, informed, and revocable consent. Silence or inaction shall imply consent only when new amendments to this constitution are proposed, with residents having the responsibility to voice their dissent if they oppose a new amendment. Majority rule shall never infringe upon the rights and freedoms of minorities without their explicit consent. No collective entity, be it government, corporations, or other organizations, shall possess rights superior to those of individuals. Individual consent shall be a prerequisite for any collective action or policy affecting individuals. Embracing the transformative power of technology, we are committed to amplifying individual participation, transparency, and real-time consent in the governance process. Our citizens will have convenient and secure avenues to propose, deliberate upon, and vote on policies that directly impact their lives. As technology advances so must our laws. To safeguard consent, any erosion of liberty, transparency, or accountability shall trigger automatic reform processes, temporarily decentralizing power until the consent of the governed is reaffirmed.\n\n10/7/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
