I feel like this was the main idea in most of Ayn Rand's books.\n\n![[https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1943867832816873811](https://x.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1943867832816873811)](https://miro.medium.com/1*e51mwdpCmQc3_TentqcjFQ.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1943874072820974047](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1943874072820974047)](https://miro.medium.com/1*OWPoPteQwAogti5xKBTHIw.png)\n\nFrom personal experience 3 things that have improved my life tremendously are praying to God, hanging with my family more, and saving any excess money I have in Bitcoin.\n\nThose 3 changes have had such a positive impact on my life.\n\n7/11/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
