  "content": "# Day 1235\n\n**The Hidden Flywheel of Tiny Habits**\n\nTonight, as I was tucking in my daughter, she reminded me of something.\n _\"We didn't brush our teeth yet.\"_\n\nSo we went and brushed them.\n\nHere's the funny thing: once my teeth were clean, I skipped the late-night snack I had been thinking about. Not because I suddenly didn't want it, but because I didn't want to brush again.\n\nThat's the magic of a small, proactive action: it changes the slope of the hill you're standing on. It tilts it in your favor.\n\nWe tend to think of habits as isolated behaviors, brush teeth, work out, save money, but good habits are rarely isolated. They create a cascade. They compound.\n\n- Brush your teeth → avoid junk food at night → sleep better → wake up sharper.\n\n- Lay out your running shoes → feel silly not using them → go for the jog → have more energy all day.\n\n- Set up automatic savings → don't even notice the money leaving → watch the account grow → feel more secure, make better long-term decisions.\n\nThese are positive flywheels: one small push in the right direction spins up benefits you never planned for.\n\nI have a [credit card that rewards me in Bitcoin.](https://creditcard.exchange.gemini.com/credit-card/apply?referral_code=jljkt4e94) Now, a credit card _can_ be a trap if you let spending outrun your means. But when used responsibly, every purchase I was going to make anyway, groceries, gas, travel, etc, quietly earns me sats back. Over years, that pile grows. It's free compounding on autopilot.\n\nThe principle is simple: Build habits that not only help you now, but also make it easier to make the _next_ good decision.\n\nBrushing my teeth tonight didn't just clean my mouth.\nIt nudged me away from junk food.\nIt nudged me toward better sleep.\nIt nudged me toward a better morning.\n\nAnd that's the real win: stack enough of those nudges, and they start to feel like momentum.\n\nBig change doesn't come from grand gestures.\nIt comes from small actions that lock in other small actions.\nStart one today.\n\n![Just imagine this is a flywheel](https://miro.medium.com/1*LR0px-3k3obJBozHsYeNeg.png)\n\n8/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
