  "content": "# Day 1112\n\nI almost slept through my workout today, but I remembered the commitment I made yesterday and said, 'Screw that!' I got up, hit the gym, and man, it felt amazing. There's nothing like kicking off your Monday with a solid workout!\n\nI also drafted up an article for hodlhodl and tomorrow I'll finish it. I should be good for a date night Wednesday. Will hit a nice run tomorrow to make sure I keep my exercise streak going. Read my chapter today. Yea my 16 goals are are going to be hit.\n\n- 1/7 reading days ✓\n\n- 1/5 workout days ✓\n\n- Working on 3 articles (1 drafted)\n\n- Date night planned for Wednesday\n\nNext on my radar: building that 3D print Shopify store when time allows. Will make it 17 goals at this rate. Rome wasn't built in a day. I just need to keep grinding, spend less time doom scrolling and more time getting shit done!\n\n![My Companie's Action Figure](https://miro.medium.com/1*4iaocbvNhEN_2h8FoMRgPg.png)\n\n4/7/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
