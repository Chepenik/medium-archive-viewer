  "content": "# Day 938\n\nGot my fiancÃ©e a new ring, and she's happy now, so that's one issue off the table. People say money can't buy happiness, and while that's true in many ways, it's not the whole story. There's definitely some happiness money _can_ buy. ðŸ˜‚  Speaking of which, my 3D printer arrived today!\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1846341494203994169](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1846341494203994169)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ogaWT3PhKFSHePC1c25Pjg.png)\n\nSetting it up was pretty awesome, and I'm excited to start printing soon. On top of that, I'm pumped to head out to LA tomorrow to meet some of my coworkers and take part in LA Bitcoin Week.\n\nI'm tired from a long day of work and moving, but I have so much to be grateful for. God is good.\n\n10/15/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
