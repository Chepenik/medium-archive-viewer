The dude calls things how he sees it and tries to find common ground regardless of one's politics. What is not to respect about that?\n\nOn another note I love trying out new AI tools and today I used [Zupyak](https://www.zupyak.com/) to create a Next.js tutorial. Honestly pretty impressed by the quality.\n\n**Creating effective landing pages with Next.js**\n\nNext.js is a powerful JavaScript framework that enables developers to build high-converting landing pages efficiently. With its rich features and seamless integration with React, Next.js offers a robust solution for creating landing pages that not only look stunning but also deliver outstanding conversion rates. In this tutorial, we will explore the potential of Next.js and discover how to leverage its capabilities to build effective landing pages.\n\n**Next.js tutorial**\n\nBefore diving into the details, it's important to have a basic understanding of Next.js. Next.js is a React framework that combines the power of server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) to provide a seamless user experience. It offers a simplified development process, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance, making it an ideal choice for building landing pages.\n\n1. Setting up a Next.js project\n\nThe first step in leveraging Next.js for creating landing pages is setting up a project. Start by installing Next.js globally using the command:\n\nnpm install -g next\n\nOnce installed, you can initialize a new Next.js project by navigating to your desired project directory and running the following command:\n\nnpx create-next-app\n\nThis command will set up a basic Next.js project structure for you to work with. You can navigate into the project folder using:\n\ncd your-project-name\n\n2. Designing the landing page layout\n\nNext.js allows you to create reusable components and design a flexible layout for your landing page. Begin by creating a new folder called \"components\" within the project directory. Inside this folder, you can define individual components such as headers, footers, forms, and more. By breaking down your landing page into smaller components, you can easily manage and update the content as needed. I've enjoyed using [https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/) personally for pre-written components you can customize.\n\n3. Implementing server-side rendering\n\nOne of the key advantages of Next.js is its support for server-side rendering (SSR). This means that the landing page is generated on the server and delivered as a complete HTML page to the client, resulting in faster loading times and better SEO performance. To implement server-side rendering, you can use the built-in getServerSideProps function provided by Next.js.\n\n```javascript\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n // Fetch landing page data from an API or CMS\n const data = await fetch('your-api-url');\n const pageData = await data.json();\n// Pass fetched data as props to the landing page component\n   return {\n     props: {\n       pageData\n     }\n   };\n}\n```\n\nThe getServerSideProps function fetches the necessary data from an API or CMS and passes it as props to the landing page component. This allows you to dynamically render content and personalize the landing page based on user data or any other criteria.\n\n4. Optimizing performance with static site generation\n\nIn addition to server-side rendering, Next.js provides support for static site generation (SSG). This enables you to generate static HTML files for each landing page during the build process, resulting in even faster loading times and improved performance.\n\nTo implement static site generation, you can use the getStaticProps function provided by Next.js:\n\n```javascript\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n // Fetch landing page data from an API or CMS\n const data = await fetch('your-api-url');\n const pageData = await data.json();\n// Pass fetched data as props to the landing page component\n  return {\n   props: {\n     pageData\n   },\n   revalidate: 60 // Regenerate the page every 60 seconds\n };\n}\n```\n\nThe getStaticProps function fetches the necessary data during the build process and generates a static HTML page. The revalidate parameter specifies the time interval after which the page should be regenerated, ensuring that the landing page remains up-to-date.\n\nConclusion\n\nNext.js is a versatile framework that empowers developers to create highly effective landing pages with ease. By leveraging its features for server-side rendering and static site generation, you can deliver lightning-fast pages that capture the attention of your audience and drive conversions. Start exploring the potential of Next.js for building high-converting landing pages and unlock new possibilities for your web development projects.\n\nIf you want the open source github and a 5 hour tutorial about how to build an amazing AI project with next.js here is a fire link.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FffJ38dBzrlY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DffJ38dBzrlY&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FffJ38dBzrlY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Ym0Bw5ik7nMneg8zERhAKw.png)\n\nI'll end this by noting to myself I need to sit down and bust out a piece for binmucker.com about Sloan going from 0 to 1.\n\n7/26/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
