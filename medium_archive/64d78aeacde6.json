  "content": "# Day 534\n\nI'm going to keep it short today because I've been writing tons of code. Speaking Java instead of english can be frustrating but if you're a dev I'm sure you can appreciate seeing this.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*HozRLJ4eqfG6MU2Oii8sbw.png)\n\n21 tests and 21 million bitcoin. Not that these tests have anything to do with Bitcoin. I just like the number 21. I watched this podcast with Bill and Joe today on my drive to Chick-Fil-A.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed%2Fepisode%2F6ybdcNPGRMRIYTwXnLVE9w%2Fvideo%3Futm_source%3Doembed&display_name=Spotify&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F6ybdcNPGRMRIYTwXnLVE9w&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2Fab67656300005f1f1707ee88231d2b54db01adf0&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=spotify\" title=\"\" height=\"351\" width=\"624\"></iframe>\n\nI know Chick-Fil-A is not healthy but man do I love their chicken sandwich and seed oil infused sauces. I'm not perfect but tomorrow I'm fasting for 24 hours and I'm writing it in my Medium because if I don't I'll wake up tomorrow and think yea I'd rather have coffee then fast. When you write down your goals it keeps you honest. I need a lil detox from the seed oils and coffee and everything.\n\nProud of myself for passing all those tests. Took me a lot of writing software (which does technically use english but in a much more logic infused way). Also did some laundry today. Let's go Chep.\n\n![it aint much but its honest work](https://miro.medium.com/0*W13R1iSjQ1qB5NgH.png)\n\n9/7/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
