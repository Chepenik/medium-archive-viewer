This perspective will change your life in ways you couldn't imagine.\n\n![Tux boi enjoying a cafeeee](https://miro.medium.com/1*HAumUB7c0sn2lSxW28Y29g.png)\n\nViewing challenges as blessings allows individuals to reframe their experiences so they can find meaning and purpose even in difficult times. This shift in perception can lead to a more optimistic outlook, increased resilience, and the ability to be grateful for life despite all its struggles. Gratitude is a superpower.\n\nI've been deeply inspired by Russell Okung's 40-day fasting challenge, which has prompted me to embark on a seven-day fast of my own. Although I'm just on day 1, I'm feeling great and optimistic about the journey ahead. This challenge presents a unique opportunity for personal growth, and I'm genuinely excited to explore its potential.\n\nLately, I've been contemplating the remarkable tendency of humans to imitate one another. Whether it's evident in our writing, software development, or even in the way we conduct ourselves, imitation plays a significant role in shaping our lives. Surprisingly, I never imagined myself voluntarily embracing a seven-day fast, but through the influence of certain NFL linemen whom I admire, I've mustered the courage to give it a try. Russell's sincere reasons for fasting resonated with me, and his exceptional writing during the fast further solidified my decision. Our actions are powerful and can shape the world for the better. Something to ponder about more often.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*K6glvnOsoC6i--4ME-jnYQ.png)\n\n7/9/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
