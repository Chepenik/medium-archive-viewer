This issue, which describes the difficulty decentralized systems have in agreeing on a single truth, plagued money for millennia until the invention of Bitcoin. The decentralized digital currency uses a Proof-of-Work mechanism and a blockchain to solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem, challenging traditional centralized systems and empowering people with greater financial control fueled by a global community's collective force.\n\nAs a bottom-up system, Bitcoin's value and strength derive from those who engage with it, learn about it, and share their knowledge. This symbiotic relationship ensures Bitcoin's significance is constantly enhanced through shared experiences. Unlike traditional top-down financial systems, Bitcoin's narrative is written by its users, making each contributor integral to its evolution and success. By educating and engaging in the Bitcoin conversation, no matter how small the role, everyone becomes a champion of this revolutionary currency, embodying the spirit of innovation and empowerment it represents. Those in control may want others to think that things are pointless, but this couldn't be further from the truth. It doesn't take much to spread and embody the spirit of innovation and empowerment that Bitcoin represents.\n\n**Pain Is The Best Teacher**\n\nOne of the reasons Bitcoin has been so successful is because compared to the traditional financial system, using Bitcoin is remarkably streamlined. Unlike banks that require extensive personal information and in-person visits, a Bitcoin public address can be generated, and a private key securely backed up in less than a minute. While banks have legitimate reasons for imposing such stringent processes, such as combating money laundering and crimes, these measures often fail to achieve their intended goals. The friction imposed by traditional banking systems will ultimately lead to their downfall or force them to embrace Bitcoin, a more straightforward and accessible system.\n\nFor those who live in regions where the banking system functions adequately, Bitcoin might not seem like a significant advancement. However, for those who have experienced the real pitfalls of fiat currency, such as hyperinflation, asset seizure, and bank failures without deposit insurance, the value of Bitcoin is profoundly understood. These individuals, who have endured the pain of flawed financial systems, are better positioned to appreciate Bitcoin's decentralized, censorship-resistant, and secure nature. It is a stark contrast to the vulnerabilities of traditional fiat currencies and banking institutions.\n\n![[https://thereformedbroker.com/2009/08/30/fdic-ious-not-quite-yet/](https://thereformedbroker.com/2009/08/30/fdic-ious-not-quite-yet/)](https://miro.medium.com/0*6RfzEhxAtDr8e4CN.jpg)\n\n**Mainstream Adoption and Awareness**\n\nIt's often overlooked that even large institutions like Fortune 500 businesses and governments are run by individuals. These individuals rely on money to work, live, and function. If money breaks down, society follows suit.\n\nOne of the beautiful aspects of Bitcoin is that it enables individuals to stay ahead of larger institutions filled with other individuals. There will likely be growing acceptance of Bitcoin by businesses, governments, and institutions as these organizations realize the limitations of fiat currency. Ironically, the very power and dominance of these institutions can breed complacency and laziness, making them slow to adapt.\n\n![[https://x.com/TimKennedyMMA/status/1384598161432317959?s=20](https://x.com/TimKennedyMMA/status/1384598161432317959?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/0*aX1_9q-QMPj0wwPP)\n\nEmbrace your struggles to create a stronger version of yourself. Then, help strengthen your friends and family. Bitcoin's transition from a niche curiosity to a formidable economic phenomenon will be amazing to witness as the asset monetizes itself for the first time. Each person who uses, invests in, or talks about Bitcoin fuels its mainstream adoption, making champions of its proponents and participants.\n\nThe grassroots adoption of Bitcoin by individuals will ultimately drive larger institutions to accept and integrate it, as they realize the need for a more robust and resilient financial system. This bottom-up approach empowers individuals to lead the charge towards a new financial paradigm, with Bitcoin at its core.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUltimately, every interaction with Bitcoin - whether through investment, mining, advocacy, or education - plays a vital role in strengthening its ecosystem. This collective engagement has propelled Bitcoin to remarkable heights, making a \"Bitcoin Champion\" out of everyone who recognizes its potential and contributes to its journey.\n\nWhile skeptics may currently dismiss Bitcoin, the beauty lies in the inevitability that one day, even they will recognize its value or risk being left behind. As [Michael Saylor aptly pointed out, everyone needs Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/_dtCYRDL4yc?si=mjGshdNXYAwK76B1). It is indeed a currency for all, and the sooner we can enlighten more individuals to become champions for this revolutionary form of money, the quicker we can liberate ourselves from the pitfalls of fiat currency.\n\n3/4/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
