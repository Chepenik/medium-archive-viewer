What a morning! Looks like we are in the \"then they fight you\" stage in regards to Bitcoin's adoption. Next comes then you win :)\n\nIt does appear Apple has reached out to Damus about discussing the zaps feature. Hopefully that call goes well but if not I will just have to find other ways to use Damus without relying on Apple. As for the Swan I don't think it's been resolved but it appears they are going ot host their own videos. A damn shame from Youtube but it shouldn't be suprising. It's a cliche for a reason. First they laugh at you, then they mock you, then they fight you, and then you win. So let's get to the winning.\n\nIt does serve as signal that these companies are going after free and open protocols. No one wants to deal with the BS of big tech, but let's face it big tech has incredible amounts of control at their fingertips. Hell if Medium wanted to erase all of my writing during these past 448 days I really would have no recourse unless I pulled all these posts down on my local machine before they did so.\n\nI've said it so many times and it still rings true: pain is the best teacher. Just need to keep using this pain as a lesson to improve my circumstances. Stay hopeful anon, Bitcoiners & Nostriches will stay winning no matter how hard the state in cahoots with big tech tries to take us down.\n\n6/13/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
