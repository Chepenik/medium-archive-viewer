I'm honestly not sure at all why a T-rex even had those short arms; what are they for?\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/TheDadAesthetic/status/1753487080335052857%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI need to make more Greek Yogurt combos. I love the idea of using some dill, chives, and pickle juice to make a good dip with chips. Also serves as a good mayo substitute.\n\nFinally, I'll link this because I'd like to remind myself to read it later.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/RRR0BYN/status/1677004486940962816%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI can't lie the tweet under it cracked me up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/RRR0BYN/status/1677011280274792448%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI have a daughter and I'm glad she has the right to vote. However, hearing perspectives that goes against everything I've been taught from a young age is important. Also this photo is hilarious.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*dMj7OQH0EB5maXd3)\n\nUltimately, democracy is a crap form of government anyways. No one should have the right to opress others because of a vote. The smallest minority is the individual. NEVER FORGET THAT!\n\nPeace and love. Go read something that makes you uncomfortable so you grow as a person.\n\n2/2/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
