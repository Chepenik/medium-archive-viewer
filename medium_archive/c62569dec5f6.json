As a Bitcoin Adoption Specialist, my daily mission is to help clients use Bitcoin to enhance their financial sovereignty. This role, although demanding, stands out as the most fulfilling I've ever held.\n\nPrior to joining Swan, I worked in tech sales which is a field often dominated by the relentless pursuit of cold calling. However, the real challenge wasn't the grind of calling strangers all day, but rather a lingering sense that my efforts weren't contributing to the greater good. There's a famous saying: \"If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.\" I believe this, but I also think that taking pride in your work and believing in its impact doesn't just eliminate the feeling of labor; it ignites a passion to rise each morning and make a positive difference in the world.\n\n**Bitcoin Only**\n\nOne of the standout features of Swan is its commitment to being a Bitcoin-only financial services company. Unlike many others, we exclusively support Bitcoin and refrain from dealing with altcoins like Ether, Dogecoin, or any others. This focus eliminates the common issues of market manipulation, unreliable projects, and ephemeral ventures that often plague the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIf you read the [about us](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/about/#:~:text=We%20want%20to%20see%20everyone,Bitcoin%20future%20for%20us%20all.) page at Swan you'll see it says \"We want to see everyone have the right to store wealth in the way they choose. It is our mission to defend and promote this right by recruiting the next 10 million Bitcoiners to help usher in a bright Bitcoin future for us all.\"\n\n**Incentives Matter**\n\nIn an industry rife with platforms that profit from encouraging frequent trading of various cryptocurrencies, Swan stands out by fostering a long-term investment approach. Many exchanges see their profits tied to client trading volume, which can unfortunately lead to negative outcomes for clients, often leaving them with substantial losses. At Swan, we prioritize a sustainable, low-time-preference strategy that enhances client satisfaction and trust. This commitment ensures our clients know they are dealing with genuine advocates for their financial well-being, not just salespeople.\n\nThis approach not only simplifies our operations but enriches our work environment. It fosters a sense of purpose and excitement among our team as we work towards a promising future marked by Bitcoin's growth and integration into the global financial landscape. Witnessing this shared commitment daily is incredibly inspiring and reinforces my dedication to the Bitcoin community.\n\n**Education Is Key**\n\nAnother thing that helped me both land a job at a Bitcoin only company and see the bright orange light is Swan's educational content. Swan Signal live, and all the Swan's out there on Twitter/X helped guide me to understand why there is no second best cryptocurrency. You see money is a winner take all market, but trying to teach people why takes a lot of work.\n\n![[About Swan - Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/about/#:~:text=We%20want%20to%20see%20everyone,Bitcoin%20future%20for%20us%20all.)](https://miro.medium.com/1*i8Ug9-gSHPfc4UDdk5kJvQ.png)\n\n**Real Diversity, Not DEI \"Quota\" Diversity**\n\nSwan's team comprises Bitcoiners from diverse backgrounds, encompassing every corner of the globe and various walks of life. Our team members differ in origin, ethnicity, skin color, and political beliefs. Yet, in my experience, we are deeply united by a mission that transcends individual differences - a mission far greater than ourselves. This shared commitment likely explains why the typical \"divide and conquer\" strategies, common in many corporate environments, fail to gain traction within the company.\n\nThis unity is particularly relevant today, as the divisiveness fostered by modern politics often distracts from pressing issues that genuinely affect our lives. In reality, the vast majority of humans, 99.7% would be my guess, do not want inflation eroding their savings, do not wish for a decline in their quality of life, and do not desire restrictions on their freedoms. Yet, these fundamental concerns are often overshadowed by polarizing debates that, in the grand scheme, have little bearing on these critical aspects of life.\n\nIt's remarkable how Bitcoin, which is essentially just a protocol, promotes global unity by addressing the unequal power dynamics and wealth disparities that stem from centralized control of money. Equal outcomes are unattainable since every human is unique. However, providing an equal playing field is essential for a flourishing society. Bitcoin embodies the true spirit of diversity, equity, and inclusion by establishing a fair environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed by providing value to others.\n\n**Don't Trust; Verify Yourself**\n\nI encourage anyone reading this to not just take my word for it - the true power of Bitcoin lies in verifying its potential for yourself. Instead, dive deep into the educational resources we offer at [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/conorchepenik/), check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Swan_Bitcoin) which hosts Swan Signal Live, the Bitcoin Daily Show and other great content. Explore [our blog](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/signal/) which has an extensive content library full of amazing written works about Bitcoin. I can only speak to my own experience but if you engage with the Bitcoin community in good faith, ask questions, and challenge assumptions you will be blown away by how much you can learn. The more you immerse yourself in understanding Bitcoin's fundamental principles and capabilities, the more you'll appreciate the palpable excitement surrounding this revolutionary technology.\n\nPlus, you'll end up a winner. Which might attract haters, but it's worth it because \"if you ain't got no haters than you ain't poppin\"\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1784748271963115590](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1784748271963115590)](https://miro.medium.com/1*VRxNOyAllD1T3y--QmvCUQ.png)\n\nDisclaimer: The author of this post is an employee of Swan Bitcoin.
