  "content": "# Day 510\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*3GnP0uFNMrHnWptp.jpg)\n\nToday I was reading _[The Body Keeps The Score](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748/ref=asc_df_0143127748/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312049124368&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1514569740090908573&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9002000&hvtargid=pla-434690707169&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=61851652213&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312049124368&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1514569740090908573&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9002000&hvtargid=pla-434690707169)_ and was fascinated to discover just how profound the impacts of childhood experiences can be on our development and adult lives. Some of the major takeaways:\n\n- Traumatic events in childhood, like abuse, neglect, or loss of a parent, can lead to long-term effects on brain development and stress response systems. This can make someone more susceptible to PTSD, anxiety, and depression later in life.\n\n- Adverse childhood experiences can alter brain structure and function in ways that make it harder to regulate emotions and impulses as an adult. This can lead to increased risk of substance abuse, eating disorders, and relationship problems.\n\n- Early attachment patterns with caregivers shape our ability to feel safe and connected in relationships as adults. Insecure attachment in childhood is associated with greater difficulty with intimacy and trust in adulthood.\n\n- Developmental trauma from growing up in a chaotic, unpredictable home environment can impair a child's ability to focus, engage in school, and develop self-esteem. This can translate to ongoing struggles with employment, finances, and stability in adulthood.\n\n- Childhood emotional neglect, where a child's feelings and experiences are minimized or dismissed, makes it harder for that individual to understand and express their emotions clearly as an adult. This can hamper relationships and well-being.\n\nThe key message is that childhood adversity and lack of stable nurturing care can have profound impacts on neurological, psychological and interpersonal development that persist through adult life. Healing and growth requires making sense of past experiences and finding ways to meet unmet developmental needs.\n\nLuckily, the book doesn't just point out the problems associated with having a rough upbringing. Here are some of the key solutions and approaches that Bessel van der Kolk suggests for helping people overcome trauma:\n\n- Psychotherapy approaches like EMDR, somatic experiencing, and sensorimotor therapy that help people process traumatic memories and experiences through bilateral stimulation of the brain and focused attention on body sensations. These can help reprogram the brain's response to triggers.\n\n- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing): This involves making side-to-side eye movements while recalling traumatic memories. The bilateral stimulation is thought to help reprocess the memories and reduce their negative emotional charge.\n\n- Somatic experiencing: This approach focuses on becoming aware of body sensations and gently releasing pent-up trauma-related energy through tremors, breathing, and movement. The goal is to restore regulation of the nervous system and tolerance of difficult emotions.\n\n- Sensorimotor therapy: This involves tracking body sensations moment-to-moment and using mindfulness, movement, and touch to reconnect with and retrain trauma-related sensorimotor reactions. The goal is to learn to modulate automatic fear responses.\n\n- Quick side note - I remeber hearing David Choe mention on JRE that at very expensive rehab they have you take a bat and hit things to release trauma/stress/etc. Seems like that is in line with what the Doctor is prescribing in his book.\n\n- Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, and theater improv are also great ways to help strengthen emotion regulation, stay grounded in the present, and learn to modulate stress responses. These mind-body practices help connect with and control physiological reactions.\n\n- Support groups and group therapy to reduce isolation and shame, receive validation from others, and benefit from shared coping strategies. Feeling understood by others with similar struggles is healing.\n\n- Family and couples therapy to identify and change relational patterns that maintain dysfunction. Working on communication, intimacy, and establishing healthy boundaries can improve close relationships.\n\n- A focus on restoring rhythms of rest, sleep, exercise, and routine to support regulation of the nervous system. Maintaining healthy lifestyle patterns bolsters resilience.\n\n- Finding meaning, purpose, and enjoyment in daily life through work, creativity, community and more. Having a sense of meaning and achievement helps overcome helplessness.\n\nThe key is tailoring a multifaceted approach to treatment based on each survivor's unique history and needs to help them process trauma, manage physiological responses, and lead a full life. Every human is different so what works for one might not work for another. Trying different things and figuring out what works for your own situation is key.\n\nI need to read more often. Not online reading, that does not count. Scrolling Twitter is easy and while I might be getting 2x smarter I'm getting 4x dumberðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. Jokes aside, it feels good to read a paper back book and learn about ways to improve my mental and physical health. It is also important I think about these things as I raise a small child. Grateful I took the time to read this morning. I learned something new and I also enjoyed using today's Medium to try and teach others about what I learned :)\n\n8/14/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
