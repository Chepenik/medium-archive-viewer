People from retail investors to central banks are waking up to this reality. I don't know how long it will take for the music to stop, but I do know that I wouldn't want to be holding bonds or cash when inflation reaches levels never before experienced in developed countries.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1790789699407052895](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1790789699407052895)](https://miro.medium.com/1*HwavtHCJ-zTXoMYLK-3omg.png)\n\nI'm bullish on the builders. On those who don't want to put up with being robbed and then lied to about it. So much of the news we consume is fake. So many of the things politicians tell us are blatant lies. The world is changing. If you want to trust humans over protocols to handle money, well, good luck to you.\n\n5/15/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
