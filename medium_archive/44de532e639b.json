  "content": "# Day 1054\n\nI had a great Friday last night watching my little sister play her first college lacrosse game with USF. She crushed it with 4 goals and her team beat Kennesaw State by double digits. I am proud of you Sofia.\n\nIt was also quite the tweet storm from Kan(Ye) this weekend. I bring this up because I feel there is something big on the horizon. Not sure what, but I do feel a general sense of anxiety. I can not put my finger on it but something is up.\n\nWhen in fear I love this quote. We are divine beings.\n\n> **Ephesians 6:12â€“13 (ESV)**\n_\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.\"_\n\nLet's act like it.\n\n2/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
