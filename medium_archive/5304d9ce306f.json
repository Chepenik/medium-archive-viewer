  "content": "# Day 611\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to all. Today I overate and got to spend time with family. 'Twas amazing.\n\nI also spent some time interviewing my parents and grandparents on camera so I can share the video with Sloan when she's older. I asked them questions about their lives, values, and advice they'd give to the next generation. It was special to capture their voices and wisdom to preserve for Sloan. I know she'll treasure being able to see and hear her ancestors speaking directly to her about how they lived and what mattered most to them. The video will give her a powerful window into understanding her heritage.\n\nGenuinely grateful for all the blessings in my life. Now I will end this with a meme and a [4chan GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-kc1xrr2PC-4chan-gpt) prompt because I overate and I'm ready to go to sleep.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*hQtBzzCVzSWaN5NuwrRsiw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*lYfYO_N0Cx9sutqwmr64qA.png)\n\nIt is impossible to be grateful and upset at the same time. Remember that anon!\n\n11/23/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
