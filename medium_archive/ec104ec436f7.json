The person's eyes should be glazed over, as if they're under the control of the machine. In the background, a cityscape or a landscape can be seen, but it's distorted and glitchy, representing the erosion of human intuition. Suddenly, a crack appears in the smartphone, and a burst of light and color explodes out, symbolizing the awakening of human intuition. The overall mood should be one of unease and rebellion. The color scheme can be a mix of dark blues and grays, representing the oppressive nature of technology, with a hint of bright, bold colors, such as red or orange, to symbolize the power of human intuition.\"](https://miro.medium.com/1*06s_eFbKOCjaOJ2kVN_76Q.png)\n\nPeople are becoming increasingly reliant on technology to inform their decisions. However, this trend raises an important question: are we losing touch with one of the most valuable assets we have as humans - our intuition? A classic episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm illustrates this point perfectly. When the weatherman predicts rain, Larry's intuition tells him otherwise, so he decides to trust his gut and verify his hunch. When Larry gets to the golf course, he sees that it's not only not raining, but the weatherman has shown up and basically has the course to himself. Sure, the weatherman was the one who made the claim, but it was technology that spread the message. Now, obviously, this is just a funny TV show, but it's a profound example of how powerful intuition is.\n\nSeriously, imagine a world where humans are no longer the primary decision-makers. Sounds like science fiction, right? But it's not. We're already living in a world where machines are increasingly calling the shots. From AI-powered personal assistants to government statistics that shape our economic policies, technology is slowly but surely eroding our intuition.\n\nIt's time to take a step back and ask ourselves: what's the true cost of outsourcing our intuition to machines? We're not just talking about the occasional incorrect weather forecast or a wonky GDP calculation. We're talking about the very fabric of our decision-making process. When we rely solely on machines, we risk losing the nuance, creativity, and emotional intelligence that only human intuition can provide.\n\nTake government statistics, for example. Those numbers might look like facts, but they're often nothing more than cleverly crafted narratives designed to manipulate public opinion. And who's behind the curtain, pulling the strings? Governments, corporations, and special interest groups with their own agendas. It's time to wake up and smell the coffee. Or in this case the massive pile of dog shit behind the curtain that government officials are trying to pass off as chocolate.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*41LKXIv-blUQaXmwqX8IKg.png)\n\nSo, what can we do? The solution is straightforward. First, acknowledge the limitations of computers and the potential biases in data. Recognize that numbers can be manipulated, and statistics can be skewed. Once you've taken this crucial step, start trusting your intuition again. Listen to your gut, pay attention to your emotions, and be willing to challenge the status quo. When the news tells you that inflation is declining, but your grocery store bill says otherwise, trust your instincts. Don't be afraid to question the narrative and seek out alternative perspectives.\n\nWith intuition we can reclaim our agency and decision-making power in a world where machines are increasingly influential. Trying to outsource your gut instincts won't help you navigate the complexities of the modern world. By acknowledging the limitations of technology and the importance of human intuition, we will create a future where more humans use machines to collaborate, rather than to control. The future is in our hands - let's not let machines dictate it for us.\n\n8/3/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
