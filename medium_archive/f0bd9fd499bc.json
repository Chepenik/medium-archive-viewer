  "content": "# Day 1067\n\n**February 21, 2025, has been wild.**\n\nA staggering ~$1.5 billion hack on ByBit has sent shockwaves through the s***coin casino, leaving traders scrambling and questioning the security of centralized exchanges. But if there's a silver lining, it's this: **this debacle highlights a fundamental difference between Bitcoin and everything else.**\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1893121143378170071](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1893121143378170071)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZSFPkRkHrJReGEm7geXVHA.png)\n\nIf a centralized exchange lost its Bitcoin, it would be **tough luck.** No bailouts. No rollbacks. No \"code is law... unless we say otherwise.\" Even if Satoshi Nakamoto himself returned, Bitcoin's immutability - enshrined in proof-of-work and its decentralized structure - **makes reversing transactions impossible.**\n\nThink about that for a second. Bitcoin is **tamper-proof.** A ledger etched in digital stone. **Capital T Truth.**\n\nThat unyielding immutability is why Bitcoin remains **a permissionless system** - no chargebacks, no do-overs. Contrast that with Ethereum, which has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to hard fork when things go south - whether it was The DAO hack in 2016 or now, potentially, over the ByBit breach. **Bitcoin prioritizes permanence over convenience, safeguarding its integrity against even the most desperate attempts to rewrite history.**\n\n![[https://x.com/CapitalSatoshi/status/1892989018410746202](https://x.com/CapitalSatoshi/status/1892989018410746202)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ou3sYeHyCgphesaRszhP3A.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/benbybit/status/1892969284587966869](https://x.com/benbybit/status/1892969284587966869)](https://miro.medium.com/1*RO-LrXYM7RvWpWjgeN9d9w.png)\n\n![Lol](https://miro.medium.com/0*z9egmwtbyw3EHzsN)\n\nLol, I **do not** envy ByBit's customer support team today. Can you imagine the sheer panic? The flood of messages? The frantic calls? That's gotta be brutal. In all seriousness, though good luck to ByBit. Maybe, in a twisted way, we owe them gratitude for yet another lesson in why **Bitcoin is different.**\n\n**Hard to buy wisdom unless your trading in bads.**\n\nSo, what's the takeaway? For me, it's a renewed appreciation for Bitcoin's amazing design. **Ethereum's flexibility comes at a cost: centralized decision-making and uncertainty. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is firm, immutable, and unstoppable. No one can hack it. No one can roll it back.**\n\nAs the crypto world grapples with today's chaos, I can't help but feel that Bitcoin's steadfastness is its greatest strength. But for now, I'll be watching closely, holding my breath, and hoping this **doesn't turn into FTX 2.0.**\n\nOnly time will tell but man, am I glad most of my digital assets **aren't sitting on an exchange.**\n\n2/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
