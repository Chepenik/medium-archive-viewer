  "content": "# Day 663\n\nToday I went to church for the first time in a long time. It was an awesome experience. My daughter Sloan got a bit fussy but she was pretty good all things considered.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*P4x1ENeNaJqyD9gnic9FNA.png)\n\nOne of the coolest parts of church was hearing the pastor talk about the value of fasting. Not everyday that a church, especially in modern times, reminds their attendees that in a world when we can have almost every need met we should take time to deprive ourselves.\n\nThe preacher pointed out this actually brings our soul closer to God. Fasting is an invitation to step back from the worldly distractions and focus on our inner spiritual journey, rekindling our relationship with God in a world that often overlooks the value of spiritual introspection and sacrifice.\n\nIn Matthew 6:17â€“18, Jesus says, \"But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\"\n\nFasting is a rewarding experience in the same way running long distances is a rewarding experience. It sucks in the moment but you feel amazing afterwards. Pushing yourself to do hard things will make you feel good things. It is paradoxical but it is true!\n\n1/14/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
