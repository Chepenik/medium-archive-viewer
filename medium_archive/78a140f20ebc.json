Imagine securing financial freedom for your family for generations with that amount - provided they understand personal finance. Yet, for the U.S. government, $3 billion merely covers the daily interest on the national debt, doing nothing to reduce the principal.\n\nWe are in a precarious situation, and it's almost inevitable that those in power will resort to printing vast sums of money to escape it. This approach will devastate those who save in USD, but those who hold hard assets will weather the storm.\n\nThis isn't financial advice. Just common sense. :)\n\nBut don't just take my word for it. I'm not even saying this tongue-in-cheek. Go verify it for yourself. It's better to learn about Bitcoin and ease into it than to view it as a trade for more dollars.\n\nIf you don't, and Bitcoin doubles from here, you'll likely just sell it for more dollars. That's shortsighted. Dollars are infinite; Bitcoin is finite. It's really that simple. Do you want to hold a currency that someone else can print out of thin air, or do you want a finite asset that people must work for with their time and energy? Me personally, I'm taking the latter!\n\n9/5/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
