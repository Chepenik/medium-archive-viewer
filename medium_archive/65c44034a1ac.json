Before Satoshi's code was released and ran in the wild, perfect money was as mythical as a unicorn's tax return. Gold? Sure, it's pretty, but it's like comparing a horse and buggy to a Tesla.\n\nOn January 3, 2009, when Satoshi flipped the switch, Bitcoin wasn't just born - it was a digital Big Bang. Fast forward 15 years, and Bitcoin stands as the perfect embodiment of digital scarcity, combining countless breakthroughs in computer science to make it possible to send value online without anyone's permission, almost as if by magic.\n\nAll you need is math and the know-how to use a public/private key pair.\n\nWatching Bitcoin grow from infancy feels like witnessing the birth of a new star, but right inside our computers. We're living in a digital renaissance, and I'm here for it.\n\nGrateful. So damn grateful.\n\n11/18/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
