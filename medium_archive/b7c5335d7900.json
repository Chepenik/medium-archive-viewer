  "content": "# Day 1052\n\n> **\"Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.\"**\n - Epicurus\n\nMan, I love this quote. Simple yet profound, and so easy to overlook.\n\nAs a kid, $20 felt like a fortune. I could walk into a gas station and go hog wild, grabbing snacks and drinks like I was a king. Now? Well, there's a whole discussion to be had about inflation, but even setting that aside, $100 today doesn't feel like much because it does not even cover my utility bills. Perspective is everything.\n\nBut just because life gets more expensive doesn't mean I should take what I have for granted. There's still so much to be grateful for. True wealth isn't just in numbers it's in appreciation.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1887463909583393176](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1887463909583393176)](https://miro.medium.com/1*eotHD4CjJAVbUjSeBAo2tg.png)\n\n2/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
