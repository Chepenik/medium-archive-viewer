You become absorbed, altered, perhaps permanently derailed by the gravity of the system according to this anon Twitter account I enjoy following.\n\n---\n\nUm. Okay. Pause. Shi* is simp right here?\n\nIronically, I turned to AI to help me define these terms so I could better grok the point and try to protect myself. What it shared with me, I think is worth sharing with you, dear reader.\n\n- **Psychosecurity** = the ability to guard your mind from manipulation, disinformation, algorithmic hijacking, mental fragmentation.\n\n- **FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second)** = proxy for AI's raw computational power.\n\n- **Event Horizon** = point of no return. In physics, once you cross a black hole's event horizon, no information can escape. Psychologically, the metaphor implies a similar collapse into irretrievable manipulation or mental disintegration.\n\nSo now the claim seems clearer:\n\n> If your capacity to maintain your mental sovereignty isn't rising faster than the pace at which computational systems are evolving to manipulate you... you are getting sucked in.\n\nIt's a warning about psychological inertia.\n\nNow the practical question: **How can we protect ourselves?** How do we build _psychosecurity_?\n\nLet's break this apart.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Know thy enemy: Algorithmic Incentives\n\nEvery algorithm on social media is designed to optimize for one thing: **engagement**.\n\nNot truth.\nNot virtue.\nNot depth.\nJust... clicking, scrolling, watching, reacting.\n\nAnd what causes that engagement?\n\n- Outrage\n\n- Fear\n\n- Sex\n\n- Tribal affirmation\n\n- Dopamine spikes\n\n- The infinite drip of novelty\n\n- Short-form stimuli that reward _reflex_, not _reflection_\n\nSo if we're going to protect ourselves, we need to **first see the algorithm for what it is**: a machine learning demon trained on your weaknesses.\n\nThat's not hyperbole. It literally predicts your behavior by exploiting cognitive shortcuts and emotional triggers.\n\n## 2. Set up your firewalls: Guard your inputs\n\nPsychosecurity = Info hygiene.\n\n- **Use RSS instead of social feeds**\n You choose _when_ and _what_ to consume. No algorithm curating.\n\n- **Remove endless scroll and autoplay**\n Tools like [Unhook](https://unhook.app/) for YouTube or browser extensions that break infinite scroll loops can reset the environment. I tried it and just seeing my Youtube screen without all the suggestions did make me stop and go woah....\n\n![So much less load on the brain not thinking about what should I listen to next](https://miro.medium.com/1*EWBLoaj0eejk4VGsgGBC-Q.png)\n\n- **Read books.** Not summaries. Not tweets.\n Real books. With friction. With focus. With structure.\n\n- **Slow down your news.**\n Use services like [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/) or [Noema](https://www.noemamag.com/) or curated newsletters with low volume.\n\nIf your psychosecurity system is like an immune system, your _daily info intake_ is your diet. Most people are eating moldy Doritos 24/7 and wondering why they feel mentally ill.\n\n## 3. Reflex vs. Reflection: Rewire the response loop\n\nThe algorithms are designed to shortcut your thinking:\n\n- You see a tweet.\n\n- You react emotionally.\n\n- You repost or reply.\n\n- You feel righteous.\n\n- The loop continues.\n\nThis is a **reflex arc** - bypassing the slow, deliberative prefrontal cortex.\n\nHow do you reclaim it?\n\n- **Wait before you share.** Give yourself 24 hours.\n\n- **Ask yourself: \"What does this _actually_ mean?\"**\n\n- **Write about it.** Writing forces you to think.\n\n\"Reading without reflecting is like eating without digesting.\"\nWe've become infovores with indigestion. Reflection is how you chew.\n\n## 4. Build internal structures: Deep goals, long arcs\n\nShort-form media shrinks your timeline.\n\nYour goals get shorter. Your focus narrows. You live by the hour. You lose the long now.\n\nBut psychosecurity demands a sense of _teleology_ - a bigger why.\n\nSome strategies:\n\n- **Write a long-term plan.** Even if you revise it constantly.\n\n- **Work on hard things that take time.** Learn piano. Write a book. Train for a marathon.\n\n- **Measure in years, not clicks.**\n\nWhen you have long arcs, you're harder to hijack. You're not tempted by every low-res emotional bait. You have trajectory.\n\n## 5. Create your own feedback loop\n\nYou need _your own_ dopamine economy - one not pegged to algorithmic coin.\n\nThat means:\n\n- **Daily rituals with no extrinsic reward** (writing, walking, prayer, coding, meditation)\n\n- **Tracking progress on things _you_ value** (not likes or comments)\n\n- **Feedback from people you trust**, not anonymous mobs\n\nBuild an **internal scoreboard**. When you have one, you no longer need the algorithm's one.\n\n## 6. Be with people. In person. Often.\n\nThis one's not optional.\n\nMost psychological derangement is a function of disconnection, alienation, hyperindividualism amplified by digital atomization.\n\nTouch grass. Touch skin. Talk in real rooms.\n\nReal humans are your best antivirus.\n\n## 7. Practice mental fasting\n\nJust as intermittent fasting strengthens the body, **info fasting strengthens the mind.**\n\n- Try **no inputs after sunset**\n\n- Or one day a week **no screens**\n\n- Or even short retreats where **you don't consume anything**, only write, walk, think\n\nIf the singularity is a kind of mental overload collapse, then _emptiness_ becomes sacred.\n\n## 8. Reclaim sacred time\n\nMost people's **attention is colonized.**\nThey don't own their mornings. Or evenings. Or their dreams.\n\nWin back:\n\n- The **first hour** of your day (no phone, only creation or silence)\n\n- The **last hour** (read physical books, reflect, talk, rest)\n\nOwn the bookends of your day = own your mind.\n\n## 9. Understand the game: FLOPs aren't just tech - they're ideology\n\nEvery increase in AI capacity also brings an **increase in ideology scale.**\n\nMore FLOPs = more memetic weapons\nMore FLOPs = deeper personalization\nMore FLOPs = more _uncanny seduction_\n\nAnd that means...\n**Your _identity_ must be actively maintained.**\n\nBecause the default path is absorption.\n\nIf you are not **becoming someone**,\nyou are being shaped into something.\n\n## 10. Have something to serve. Bigger than self.\n\nIf you worship your own emotions, you're easy to manipulate.\n\nBut if you serve a higher ideal - truth, love, freedom, Bitcoin, Family, God - something that gives you backbone.\n\nPsychosecurity = Soul anchored in something stable.\n\nEven the best FLOPs can't fake integrity.\n\nSo, to answer the question:\n\n> _**How can we beat the algos designed to addict us?**_\n\nWe become deeper humans.\n\n- With better inputs\n\n- With reflective outputs\n\n- With stronger identity\n\n- With community\n\n- With sovereignty of time, mind, and values\n\nThat's psychosecurity.\n\nIt won't be easy. But it's possible.\n\nAnd necessary.\n\n6/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
