  "content": "# Day 967\n\nI caught up with an old friend of mine who I had not spoke with in a long time today. We chatted for like two hours straight it was fantastic.\n\nThis was the kid who first told me about Bitcoin. Funny because he reached out due to the price action of Bitcoin.\n\nHe seems to be doing well and I hope to do a podcast with him soon. So fascinating to catch up with the homies. Also amazing when you start catching up with an old friend and you just pick up right where you left off. Like no time had expired since we last saw each other.\n\nAnyways, I meant to get some stuff done tonight, but the conversation derailed me as it went two hours and I'm glad it did. Man it feels good to have good friends. Grateful for all my brothers out there.\n\nConsider this your reminder to call that friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Don't hesitate. Embrace the connection - you'll be glad you did. Life is always better when we reach out, when we share a laugh, when we reconnect with our people.\n\n![ChatGPT kept giving me images of dudes holding hands then finally made one like I wanted but I couldn't decide which so I grabbed both. Deal with it :P](https://miro.medium.com/1*rE5_K3pVS79k6wzWQPLtrA.png)\n\n11/13/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
