  "content": "# Day 1070\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1894185119411241278](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1894185119411241278)](https://miro.medium.com/1*OQhIbR9Roc_r3soaCcS72A.png)\n\nSo for this 5 (really 7) part list I made yesterday let's check in on my progress:\n\n1. **Complete three Bitcoin news articles.** (1/3 completed and already working on the second)\n\n2. **Deploy a breathing app online.** (Done check out [breathbetter.io](https://breathbetter.io))\n\n3. **Go on a date night with my wife.** (Planned for this Thursday)\n\n4. **Practice breathing exercises every day this week.** (I did a breathing session with my daughter and one while writing this)\n\n5. **Clear the back porch of all bricks and stones to prepare for pouring a new concrete pad with my father-in-law's help.** (I still have some work to do here, but I've made solid progress and will actually need to keep a few concrete slabs until we're ready to pour concrete so my grill has something to rest on.)\n\n6. **Improve my Binmucker.com website with a fun game users can play while clicking around.** (Literally left this Medium mid writing and built it, shipped it, and it's now live at [binmucker.com](https://binmucker.com))\n\n7. Make 7 memes I post on X.com (1/7 done)\n\nMan it really is great to write down your goals. Makes it a lot easier to complete them.\n\n![[https://x.com/tyromper/status/1894187409610293459](https://x.com/tyromper/status/1894187409610293459)](https://miro.medium.com/1*Ur89zytwOSf00a9OVEufNg.png)\n\nTomorrow I am going to coach a great flag football game to help the kids win, I will be more present with my family, and I will focus more at work and not let myself get distracted. Finally, I will continue to crush my list so it's completed at the end of the week.\n\n2/24/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
