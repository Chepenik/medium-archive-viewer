  "content": "# Day 1061\n\n![[https://x.com/Darkfarms1/status/1890425309314396211](https://x.com/Darkfarms1/status/1890425309314396211)](https://miro.medium.com/1*7ALfYfzMVg4-_LWu6iqYzA.png)\n\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect perfectly describes the crypto journey: the less you know, the more confident you are that you'll outsmart the market.\n\nMost people enter crypto thinking they are the next Michael Burry, ready to time the market perfectly. They build the ultimate altcoin portfolio, dreaming of retiring by Tuesday. The lucky ones hit a 10x on some random dog coin, take a screenshot (but never sell), and suddenly they're a trading genius. Peak 'I watched a YouTube trading video once' energy üìà\n\nThe market humbles them while they're still crafting the perfect Twitter brag post. Their portfolio bleeds out, they panic sell the bottom, and swear off crypto forever while doom-scrolling Bitcoin obituaries. Classic valley of despair. But for those who stick around and actually study why Bitcoin is different...\n\nThey finally reach enlightenment. Meaning they want to stack as many sats as possible and HODL them for their bloodline. Funny how it takes the pain of losing money to realize the winning strategy was the simplest all along: buy bitcoin, secure it in a geographically distributed multi-sig wallet, and literally do nothing else. No trading, no selling, no trying to time the market. The galaxy brain moment when you understand that doing less is more üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHere is my 2 sats if you're just starting your crypto journey: K.I.S.S. As Michael Saylor says, 'There is no second best cryptocurrency.' If you want to avoid the valley of despair do yourself a favor and study why Bitcoin is different from everything else in the space.\n\n2/15/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
