  "content": "# Day 485\n\nPatrick Bet-David is an incredible podcast host. These two episodes are some of the best entertainment I have ever watched. Grateful to be alive during this media revolution.\n\n> [**Anthony Weiner MELTDOWN | PBD Podcast | Ep. 287**](https://www.youtube.com/live/u8sKo4KQO-E?feature=share)\n\n&\n\n> [**Dave Smith | PBD Podcast | Ep. 288**](https://www.youtube.com/live/drDwGz6D9ic?feature=share)\n\nThe Anthony Weiner podcast is insane because it appears to confirm many of the suspicions around the Clintons. It was also funny to think Weiner is doing his own show and not using YouTube, Spotify or any video platform but rather radio. This format of long form podcasting must've been different to someone used to radio shows.\n\nThe Dave Smith podcast was just based because it was on the same day and they got to discuss the earlier podcast. Also I appreciate Dave's perspective on politics. Both podcasts are worth watching all the way through.\n\n7/20/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
