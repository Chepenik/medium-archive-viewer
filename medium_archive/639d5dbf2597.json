  "content": "# Day 798\n\nThe day is filled with countless distractions, and I often find myself wondering just how many times I check my phone within a 24-hour period. It's likely more frequent than I'd care to admit. I estimate it's around 240 times a day, which translates to an astonishing average of once every 6 minutes. This realization is both staggering and humbling.\n\nIronically, I got distracted even while composing this. Perhaps it's time to seek some guidance from ChatGPT to help me find my way to a moment of meditation.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*uW-w00GlHDhTXe3w.jpg)\n\nI love this statement. Zooming out seems to help me find the zen.\n\n5/28/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
