  "content": "# Day 107\n\nI almost didn't post tonight. Was at a bar with a good friend and he got a call that a family member passed away. Honestly didn't know how to react to the situation. Did my best to comfort a friend but it's difficult to imagine what someone is going through when something like that happens. Even if you've lost family before and can emphasize and relate; every relationship is its own unique situation.\n\nlife is truly precious. Seeing my buddy go through that kind of pain he went through tonight really puts things in perspective. It's easy to get sad, frustrated, or even bored going through the day-to-day activities of life, but tonight was a reminder of how precious every second is. Grateful to have all I do.\n\nPraying for my buddy.\n\nLife is hard. It's also a gift. Keep your head up anon‚úäüèΩ  It's a long strange trip.\n\n7/7/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
