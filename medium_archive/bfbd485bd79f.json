  "content": "# Day 1231\n\nMaintenance is the unglamorous super-power that keeps chaos from staging a coup. Tonight's episode of my lifelong war on entropy looked like this: I shaved the stubble that was masquerading as a beard, enjoyed a run and a post-run shower, brushed the pearly whites, chomped a vitamin C chewable like a Flintstones addict, and slapped on a nasal strip so heroic it deserved theme music about buying Bitcoin and sleeping better. Mid-paragraph, I even hit \"pause\" on my writing to maintain the battlefield, em, ...my workspace.\n\nI returned to said battlefield only to discover my toddler had redecorated the office in the avant-garde style known as \"Category 5 Toynado.\" Old photos, rogue DVDs, and a glittering constellation of crayons everywhere. Strangely, I'm grateful. Her mini-cyclone forces me to revisit memories, dust off artifacts, and remember that maintenance isn't punishment but rather proof of life. Entropy never clocks out; we just get better tools and smaller generals (thanks, kid) to fight it.\n\nMoney works the same way. The U.S. dollar? High-entropy sludge, forever leaking value, demanding constant patch jobs. Bitcoin? Low-entropy elegance, hard, predictable, less needy than a succulent. The goal is to leverage these lower entropy systems to rig your life so that more of your energy compounds instead of evaporates.\n\nSo here's the checklist for beating entropy and boosting joy in one's life, according to me, ze Binmucker...\n\n1. **AI** - Automate the drudgery; save brain-cells for art and adventure.\n\n2. **Bitcoin** - Store value where the money printer does not corrupt it.\n\n3. **Health** - Upgrade the hardware that runs the whole show.\n\nHealth is wealth. I keep thinking that phrase to myself. Maintain, build, iterate. Because the universe trends toward chaos, but you don't have to.\n\n![You can just shave things](https://miro.medium.com/1*tIkez6j35c8ODW-AEGk9Lw.png)\n\n![As God is our Father he wants us to be the Father our children need.
