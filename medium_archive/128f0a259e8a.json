  "content": "# Day 420\n\nIf there was ever a day to get high and write, well today seems like a fitting one. Alas I am not going to get high tonight because I am tired and spent the majority of the day staring at a computer screen and then crushing a short run before doing a podcast with my buddies Jack, Peter, and Jon.\n\nIt was a real treat talking with 3 gentlemen who are doing the right thing. Spending time with quality men has me excited about a quality future. Stop focusing on the bs that is all over social media. This is as much a note to myself as it is to the reader. Spend more time engaging with individuals who you know are trying to better themselves. It will make your life better.\n\nAlso get more sunlight. It's free!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*iH8Fe4OPo0mxXlG5)\n\nCheers anon\n\n5/16/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
