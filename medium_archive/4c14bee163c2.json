Upon sharing the news with my Dad, he revealed that he had been praying for this outcome all along. Learning of this deepened my faith even more.\n\nIt's ironic that as I've delved down the Bitcoin rabbit hole I have grown closer to God. God works in mysterious ways. My greed brought me to Bitcoin, but learning about how it could create a better world is what kept me learning. When you realize that something can help so many people it becomes clear that you should devote more time to it. Also, important to note that while the love of money can be a root of evil, money itself is not inherently bad. It is the obsession with money that is devastating to one's spirit.\n\nSomething I need to remember is that if you never ask then the answer is a no. If you do ask there is no guaranteed yes but I have found that when you ask God for something you will receive exactly what you need. I am immensely grateful for both my heavenly and earthly Fathers. Without them, I would be nothing. God has done so much for me and my family, and this experience has strengthened my conviction that He actively shapes the lives of those who love Him. God will always provide, in His own timing, for those who ask.\n\n12/13/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
