  "content": "# Day 690\n\n690 days of writing every single day...nice.\n\nI'm going to keep this one short, but I want to speak to those who are thinking about having kids: do it.\n\nChoosing to have children ranks as one of the most rewarding decisions you'll ever make. The return on investment (R.O.I) from raising children surpasses any other form of investment because true love, the kind that is unconditional and pure, cannot be purchased with any amount of money. While wealth can procure many things, it falls short in delivering the unique joy and fulfillment that comes from the experience of parenting.\n\nDo not overthink this! In Genesis 1:28, after creating humans in His image, God blessed them and said: \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\"\n\nThis command was stated as part of God's initial blessing to humanity, instructing them to populate the earth and establish their stewardship over the kingdom he created for all of us. It reflects God's intention for humans to procreate, thrive, and responsibly manage the world's resources and creatures, thereby participating in the creation and maintenance of life on earth.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*2_1EvK_6vznF_rtO)\n\n2/10/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
