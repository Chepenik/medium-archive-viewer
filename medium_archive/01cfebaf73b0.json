  "content": "# Day 1156\n\nTime to return to my children's book project! Bitcoin reached a new all-time high today, an expected milestone in its journey to becoming the next global reserve currency. My picture book will help young children understand why Bitcoin matters through colorful illustrations and simple stories, introducing them to this important part of our future economy in a way that's both fun and easy to grasp.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*44Z6d0-hBPjt39sRFr-Xhw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*kA6wv8SJGrYBQL_-sjHr7w.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*OnVcBxUWEMD5s-KVmHiJwA.png)\n\n3 down. 18 more designs to go :)\n\n5/21/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
