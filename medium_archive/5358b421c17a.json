  "content": "# Day 791\n\nBitcoin's potential as a revolutionary power projection technology, as explored by Jason P. Lowery in \"[Softwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin](https://amzn.to/3wJ0Evk),\" presents a compelling argument for its positive impact on the planet and the empowerment of individuals. Lowery's Power Projection Theory suggests that Bitcoin's proof-of-work protocol can function as an electro-cyber power projection mechanism, allowing nations and individuals to secure their information and impose costs on adversaries in cyberspace without resorting to physical violence.\n\nLowery emphasizes that one of the most intriguing aspects of this theory is its potential to incentivize cooperation over coercion. Traditional power dynamics often rely on coercive measures, such as military force or economic sanctions, to assert dominance and maintain control. However, Bitcoin's decentralized nature and the concept of a global-scale electro-cyber militia introduce a new paradigm where nations collaborate to enhance network security, ensuring mutual assured preservation. This fosters cooperation, as adversarial nations become invested in the collective well-being of the network.\n\nBitcoin empowers individuals and protects them from exploitation by larger entities, including governments. By providing a permissionless and decentralized system, Bitcoin enables individuals to secure their most valuable information and digital assets without relying on centralized authorities. This democratization of power challenges traditional power structures and safeguards individual rights and freedoms online.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin's digital and decentralized nature makes it inherently more secure and less prone to theft through violence compared to physical assets. With traditional forms of wealth like cash, valuables, or property, there is an incentive for criminal actors to resort to violent means like robbery or home invasions to acquire these assets from others. However, Bitcoin's asset is informational and stored through cryptography, making it extremely difficult to forcibly take someone's holdings through physical force or coercion. This reduces the incentive for violent crimes surrounding the acquisition of wealth. Bitcoin's non-physical nature enables seamless storage and transfer without risking one's personal safety. Rather than escalating conflict through the threat of violence, Bitcoin's cyber capabilities provide a more peaceful path to storing and exchanging value globally.\n\nCritics who oppose Bitcoin's adoption may be shortsighted, failing to recognize its potential to reshape global power dynamics and promote cooperation. By embracing Bitcoin's proof-of-work technology, individuals will transform their security posture, protect digital resources, and revolutionize the global balance of power in a more cooperative manner.\n\n![Bitcoin is peace](https://miro.medium.com/1*x2uDoVKTvthwIJvLODQdDA.png)\n\n4/21/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
