The Constitution explicitly places monetary authority with Congress, but today, this power largely rests in the hands of an unelected body: the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison strongly advocated for centralized monetary policy to ensure stability and unity among the states. Hamilton, in particular, argued passionately that Congress must retain clear authority over money to effectively regulate the economy. Although Hamilton supported the creation of a national bank, even he envisioned an institution fully subordinate to congressional oversight, not an independent, privately influenced cartel.\n\nHowever, the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913 marked a profound departure from this original intent. By outsourcing monetary policy to a private, centralized institution, Congress abdicated a core constitutional responsibility, and in doing so, shifted the balance of power fundamentally away from democratic accountability.\n\nThe transfer of power to a fiat currency system has had far-reaching and profound consequences. Rather than enjoying a stable monetary foundation, Americans have faced decades of persistent inflation, disruptive boom-and-bust cycles, and an ever-growing national debt.\n\n![It took the United States well over 100 years to accumulate its first $10 trillion of national debt, but less than a decade to add the next $10 trillion.](https://miro.medium.com/1*GvJPdbF8L69Q2rNZwMs_jA.png)\n\nWith the Federal Reserve able to print money at will, ordinary citizens are left watching helplessly as relentless inflation erodes the value of their savings. While states lack the authority to create currency, the Fed exercises this power freely, often diminishing citizens' purchasing power to sustain a financial system that disproportionately benefits rent-seekers at the expense of those who create real value.\n\nFar from providing the stability it promised, the Federal Reserve's policies have repeatedly triggered economic crises. From amplifying the Great Depression with misguided interventions to fueling the speculative bubbles that culminated in the 2008 Financial Crisis, centralized monetary control has consistently driven volatility. By enabling endless money creation and maintaining artificially low interest rates, the Fed fosters a dangerous addiction to debt.\n\nThis much debt incentivizes unchecked government borrowing, as congressional oversight remains toothless, normalizing reckless deficit spending. The result is trillions in unsustainable debt, burdening future generations. While Congress shares blame with its exorbitant multi-trillion-dollar spending bills, such excess would be impossible without the Fed and Treasury conjuring dollars from thin air, backed by little more than fiat decree.\n\n![Liquidity, just a little more liquidity. [https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12y48u0/robin_williams_brilliant_takedown_of_banks_in_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12y48u0/robin_williams_brilliant_takedown_of_banks_in_the/)](https://miro.medium.com/1*1Mm4xscjyR5M7Y_6xr3zIQ.png)\n\nSupporters of the Federal Reserve often defend its independence, arguing that monetary policy should remain insulated from politics. While superficially appealing, this position ignores a fundamental democratic principle: the holders of significant power should be directly accountable to the people. The Fed, insulated from elections and public influence, answers largely to powerful banking interests rather than the voters.\n\nBut perhaps the most troubling legacy of Congress's abdication of monetary authority is the rise of an unchecked class of financial kleptocrats who thrive under fiat money. Inflation acts as a hidden tax, silently eroding the wealth of ordinary people while transferring resources upward to the financial elites who benefit directly from Fed policies.\n\nOf course, wealth creation through genuine value should be celebrated and nurtured, but fiat currency unfortunately enables moral hazard and rent-seeking instead. At the same time, it hampers true value creators by imposing burdensome regulations, tilting the playing field against them.\n\nHowever, there is hope on the horizon in the form of Bitcoin a monetary system aligned with the Founders' vision of honest, sound money. Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is decentralized, scarce, permissionless, and resistant to manipulation. It offers individuals a level of economic sovereignty that the current system cannot. Bitcoin removes the need for intermediaries, empowering people to reclaim more control over their finances, free from the whims of unelected bureaucrats or kleptocrats.\n\nIf the Founding Fathers were alive today, they might well recognize Bitcoin as a revolutionary force for liberty and individual sovereignty. In Bitcoin, the people regain control of their economic destiny, free from the hidden taxation of inflation and the whims of those who exploit the current fiat system.\n\nUltimately, the constitutional crisis created by the Federal Reserve demands urgent reflection and action. Congress must reclaim its constitutional responsibility or risk further erosion of democratic accountability and freedom. Yet, even if Congress fails to act, individuals have the unprecedented opportunity to choose Bitcoin: currency beyond the reach of kleptocrats and aligned with principles of liberty, justice, and sovereignty.\n\n![Bitcoin is the constitution in cyberSpace](https://miro.medium.com/1*NMik_F_hbduMX3Yz1WmK0A.png)\n\nAmerica stands at a pivotal moment. **We must choose between continuing down the path of unchecked monetary control by an unelected body or returning power to the people through decentralized money.**\n\nIn Federalist â„–10, James Madison warned:\n\n**\"The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union, than a particular member of it.\"**\n\nThe Founders understood the dangers of paper money and centralized power. Yet, the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 betrayed their vision, allowing inflation and debt to erode the nation's wealth over generations.\n\nI believe a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve offers a path to escape the paper money system imposed by Central Banks. Over time, an S.B.R. would reclaim sovereignty and realign with the Founders' principles - fortifying the Union against destructive ideas like fiat currency, debt cancellation schemes, and the erosion of private property, hallmarks of socialist ideologies.\n\nBitcoin is more than just 1s and 0s running on a computer. It's what will return America to a sound money standard and bring back the spirit of liberty to every red blooded American.",
