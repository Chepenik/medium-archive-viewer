Talk about a follow up from the Trump x Tucker interview. While I have Ukranian heritage (which at the time was part of the U.S.S.R so in a sense it's Russian heritage) I have not got the slightest clue how Russian's feel about their leader. Like all leaders I'm sure some people hate him and others love him. What I do know is that nuclear war is bad. Like devastingly bad! Understanding multiple perspectives is so important and I'm sure Putin would make some fair points. It saddens me to learn from the interview I shared above that Tucker had his phone hacked by the NSA so they could see his signal messages.\n\nClearly the deep state would not like this interview to happen as it would give Putin a platform to speak freely. That said, I believe that the American people have a right to hear what Putin has to say. After all, he's the leader of a nuclear power.\n\nTucker is right about privacy. A free society cannot exist without it. Sending all this money to Ukraine is already wildly unpopular. An interview where Putin can speak freely with one of America's top journalists would be a valuable opportunity for the American people to learn more about the war in Ukraine and the Russian perspective.\n\nThere are no winners in war. I hope we can soon reach an agreement so young men can stop fighting a war on behalf of leaders who do not have to face the same consequences as the soldiers they send into battle.\n\nIncentives play an integral role in shaping outcomes. The swiftness of resolving conflicts like the ongoing war hinges on the actions of the leaders directing it and the financiers backing it. Imagine if these leaders were personally connected to the consequences by sending their own children to the frontlines. This emphasis on incentives cannot be overstated, particularly when dealing with intricate systems. Were leaders to experience tangible stakes, such as their own offspring in harm's way, the futility of this war would become apparent and lead to its immediate cessation.\n\nWhile this scenario may not materialize in the near future, its significance remains undeniable. This notion brings to mind Warren Buffet's statement, wherein he proposed a rapid solution to deficits: institute a law that renders sitting members of congress ineligible for reelection if the deficit surpasses 3% of GDP.\n\nPersistently seeking to comprehend incentives and diverse viewpoints is of paramount importance. Doing so is vital in countering the pervasive influence of propaganda. Consider the prospect of a dialogue between Tucker Carlson and Vladimir Putin - a conversation that holds the potential to facilitate de-escalation and peace. Enabling Russia's leader to openly communicate with the American populace could pave the way for reducing tensions, a goal that aligns with the interests of all parties involved.\n\n8/28/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
