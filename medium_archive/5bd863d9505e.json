  "content": "# Day 449\n\nToday my buddy Dan came over to chat about Payjoin & Bitcoin on my podcast. It was a real pleasure doing an in person rip. We also talked about community and Dan pointed out the value in having roots somewhere. We both agreed travel & being a digital nomad is amazing, but so is having a badass community where you live full time.\n\nBitcoin fixes many things but it does not fix having a support group you can rely on. As a matter of fact Bitcoin requires extreme ownership. However, the group of Bitcoiners you meet along the way can be very helpful. It's such a paradox because Bitcoin is money and it's important to not obsess over money. Luckily, Bitcoin is also so much more than just money. It teaches you a lot of things and one of the most important lessons it can teach you is that community is everything. Grateful humanity now has a tool that can connect everyone around the world. One where it requires knowledge by the user to consider tradeoffs. Which fortunately with bitcoin the user can agree to naturally because there is no coercion or threat of violence from the state decreeing you must use this money. In 21 million we trust.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*sm62qDEclAPSFd2Y)\n\nP.S AI is becoming very helpful for my day to day tasks.\n\n6/14/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
