Proud of how it ended up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1630944615456030720%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nOn another note I finally got Damus working on my iPhone. For those unaware that is a client for iOS to use Nostr. If you are unaware of what Nostr is then I recommend checking this video out. Worth watching to see what the next Twitter might look like.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FyIccRIEr2gQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyIccRIEr2gQ&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FyIccRIEr2gQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nUltimately I think both platforms will end up coexisting. There are benefits and negatives to both centralized and decentralized platforms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*NQjDyzG7L01SyLgK)\n\nThese differences are interesting to consider so here are 5 examples I thought of. If I missed one you are thinking about leave it in the comments. I'd love to learn what other people are thinking when weighing these options.\n\n1. \"Decentralized platforms like Nostr offer users more control over their data and privacy, while centralized platforms like Twitter provide more convenience and accessibility.\"\n\n2. \"The issue with centralized platforms like Twitter is that they can be vulnerable to censorship and data breaches, while decentralized platforms like Nostr are more resilient to such threats.\"\n\n3. \"Despite the benefits of decentralized platforms, centralized platforms like Twitter have a larger user base and offer more features like enhanced UI, making it difficult for Nostr to compete in terms of popularity and functionality. This might change with time, but for now Twitter has the lead in regards to users.\"\n\n4. \"Centralized platforms like Twitter are easier to moderate and enforce community guidelines, whereas decentralized platforms like Nostr offer free speech regardless of how harmful the content might be. There is no easy answer here because it is not great having no way to deal with death threats, but it's also horrible how far Twitter took their censorship. The [Twitter files](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394?s=20) exposed a lot and I recommend checking those out if you haven't already.\"\n\n5. \"Ultimately, it's up to the users to decide which platform they prefer. Some may prioritize privacy and security, while others may prioritize convenience and connectivity, and both centralized and decentralized platforms can coexist to cater to these different needs.\"\n\nHahaha I've seen people joke Twitter will become just a place to find people's npubs. Maybe one day but for the remaining 2020s I think Twitter will remain relevant.\n\nI'll wrap this up by pointing out that most things in life have tradeoffs. The smart people consider these tradeoffs before making a decision.\n\n3/1/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
