However, it is also the technology that enabled the flourishing of human civilization. Modern money solved immense inefficiencies in ancient exchange systems, freeing people to specialize, trade, and progress. As we enter a new monetary era, it helps to examine the origins of money and why it was such a breakthrough innovation.\n\nIn pre-monetary societies, exchange was limited to primitive barter systems. Two parties had to each possess something the other desired for a transaction to occur. This \"double coincidence of wants\" was rare and made trade frustratingly limited.\n\nImagine a farmer wanting to exchange potatoes for wheat. He had to find another farmer who wanted potatoes and who had wheat to spare. What if the potential barter partner already had a pile of potatoes but desperately needed milk? No luck. Under barter, goods had to directly coincide.\n\nSearching for these coincidental matches required immense time and energy. People spent more hours scouring the village for barter partners than actually working and producing goods. Even if two compatible producers were found, dividing and storing bartered goods was near impossible. Over time, perishable assets like potatoes would rot away, making delayed exchanges impractical.\n\nModern money solves these limitations by acting as a universally accepted intermediary. Instead of bartering potatoes for wheat, the potato farmer can sell his goods for coins. He then uses these coins to purchase wheat from any seller, even if they have no use for potatoes. Money becomes the intermediate asset that connects the two parties.\n\nThis enables a fluid and efficient trade economy. Producers can devote time to perfecting their craft rather than chasing ideal barter deals. Storing and transporting value in durable coins is far easier than hauling around sacks of deteriorating potatoes. Splitting payments is as simple as dividing coin piles, unlike attempting neat splits of grain bushels or livestock.\n\nMoney also allows greater specialization, as the coincidence limitation disappears. Skilled crafters can spend years honing their trade and exchanging the resulting goods for money, without worrying whether each buyer has something they personally need. This specialization of labor is a key driver of technological and societal advancement.\n\nWhile early physical forms of money like gold coins were a catalyst for human development, today's fiat currencies reveal serious flaws. Since abandoning the gold standard in 1971, governments have monopolized money issuance and pumped massive sums of new fiat dollars into circulation. This hidden taxation through inflation has led to ballooning inequality and distortions in market signals.\n\nIn a just monetary system, money should represent real economic value rather than manipulation by central planners. Bitcoin's provably scarce design harkens back to the ideal qualities that made gold a sound form of money for centuries.\n\nBitcoin's supply is sourced through a competitive, open \"mining\" process. Miners expend real-world energy to verify transactions and mint new digital coins. This proof-of-work model closely mimics the process of mining precious metals, except it monetizes stranded energy across the globe rather than expanding energy consumption solely to extract gold.\n\nThe bitcoin protocol mathematically ensures that new supply enters the market at a fixed, predictable rate that cannot be altered. This prevents sudden supply shocks that distort economic signals under fiat money regimes.\n\nMoreover, bitcoin's supply is truly finite, capped at 21 million coins. This essential digital scarcity gives bitcoin intrinsic value independent of government decree. Gold provides scarcity, but has limitations like storage and transport that don't apply to digital assets.\n\nIn addition, bitcoin enables instant global peer-to-peer transactions and micropayments at a scale not possible with physical coins. The Lightning Network allows fast, cheap bitcoin transfers and scaling.\n\nBoth bitcoin and precious metals like gold serve as \"bearer assets\" whose value is derived from the free market rather than by decree. However, bitcoin's fixed supply and digital nature make it the most verifiably scarce monetary asset ever created. In a world of government currency manipulation, bitcoin's scarcity provides a foundation for an honest, ethical, and globally accessible monetary system.\n\nFar from evil, honest money like Bitcoin could be the next breakthrough that propels humanity into a future of greater equality, productivity, and individual sovereignty. The internet enabled the exponential spread of information. Bitcoin may do the same for exchange and money.\n\nAnthropologists still debate the exact origins of early physical money. But its advantages over simple barter systems are undeniable. As we enter a new paradigm of digital currency, society must remember the core purpose of money - facilitating fair, ethical, efficient exchange between people. By choosing sound monetary technologies, we bring that vision a step closer. The coincidences that create shared prosperity emerge from small sparks of innovation.\n\n7/30/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
