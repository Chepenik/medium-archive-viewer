  "content": "# Day 846\n\nWent dirt-biking today. It feels so badass having a combustion engine rumble beneath you while you haul ass and drive over dirt, rocks, and mud. Idaho and Montana are truly breathtaking, God's country. The day was special, and a fantastic reminder that life is about the journey, not just the destination. But it's nice to know that a great destination awaits.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*oh6KhKniyZrQSTekVN9isg.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*zLPKF5dLFmPkyD8jvpIaRQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*3r2Gvkg9m2L_oQRLCyb_lw.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*OX2uRsltBY7qzk_KVkG7OQ.png)\n\n7/15/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
