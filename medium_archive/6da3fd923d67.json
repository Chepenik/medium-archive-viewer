While it's primarily used in scientific research, some aspects of the scientific method can be applied to making money in a general sense. Here's how you can adapt the scientific method in your financial decision-making:\n\n1. Observation and Question: Just as in scientific research, the process begins with starting from a place of I don't now and observating. In the context of making money, you might observe trends in the market, financial news, or opportunities in your personal financial situation. Your questions could revolve around how to maximize your income, invest wisely, or reduce expenses.\n\n2. Research and Information Gathering: To make informed financial decisions, gather relevant data and information. This could include studying financial markets, understanding investment options, analyzing your own financial situation (income, expenses, debt), and staying updated on economic trends and news.\n\n3. Hypothesis: Formulate a hypothesis or a set of potential solutions to your financial question. For example, you might hypothesize that investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds will generate higher returns over the long term compared to keeping your money in a savings account.\n\n4. Experimentation: In financial decision-making, experimentation often takes the form of trying out different strategies. For instance, if you hypothesized that investing in stocks and bonds is a good strategy, you might start with a small investment and monitor its performance over time.\n\n5. Data Collection and Analysis: Collect data on your financial experiments and analyze the results. Did your investments generate the expected returns? Did your budgeting efforts reduce your monthly expenses? Use data and metrics to evaluate your financial decisions objectively.\n\n6. Conclusion: Based on the results of your experimentation and analysis, draw conclusions about the effectiveness of your financial strategies. If the evidence supports your hypothesis, you may continue with the strategy. If not, you may need to adjust your approach.\n\n7. Refinement: Just like in scientific research, the financial process is iterative. If your initial financial decisions didn't yield the desired outcomes, refine your strategies and repeat the process. Learn from your mistakes and successes to make better financial decisions in the future.\n\n8. Peer Review and Expert Advice: In the scientific method, findings are often subject to peer review. In financial decision-making, seeking advice from financial experts, mentors, or trusted individuals can provide valuable perspectives and help you make more informed choices.\n\n9. Consistency and Reproducibility: Maintain consistency in your financial practices and strategies, and strive for reproducibility. This means that if you discover a successful financial strategy, you should be able to apply it consistently to achieve similar results.\n\n10. Ethical Considerations: While the scientific method emphasizes objective analysis, financial decision-making also requires weighing ethical principles. For me, saving in bitcoin aligns with my ethical values and principles. I believe bitcoin represents the soundest form of money, as described by Ayn Rand in her views on the ideal characteristics of money. Bitcoin's decentralized and transparent nature gives me confidence in its ability be a deflationary, decentralized money no single human controls. Saving in bitcoin reflects my ethical conviction that it is the future of money and promotes economic freedom and financial inclusion worldwide.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZ9HbQsTgrtk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ9HbQsTgrtk&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZ9HbQsTgrtk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nFinancial decision-making is not always as straightforward or controlled as scientific research. It involves factors like risk tolerance, market volatility, and personal circumstances. Additionally, there are no absolute truths in finance, so decisions are often based on probabilities and informed judgments. Nonetheless, applying a structured and evidence-based approach to your financial choices can help you make more informed decisions and potentially improve your financial well-being over time. Hope this helps you. This post is not financial advice but my personal advice is learn about Bitcoin, the rabbit hole is fascinating.\n\n9/9/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
