  "content": "# Day 728\n\nA buddy sent me this the other day.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*MHQoS3HvxzVU0qtghdiZag.png)\n\nOne of the things I miss most about Boston was the bitdevs meet up. It was always funny when Fidelity hosted it and across the street was the Boston Fed.\n\nBitcoin has been extremely volatile lately but it's amazing to see how fast the signal is spreading. I'm sure I'm in an echo chamber but it really does seem like more people are waking up. No one likes being stolen from.\n\nI'm glad that we now have the best form of property rights ever created. Humanity will flourish the more it embraces Bitcoin. At least that's my opinion. Only time will tell if I'm correct, but I do have a good feeling I will be.\n\nðŸ¤ž\n\n3/19/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
