  "content": "# Day 716\n\nToday, I will analyze the three primary shoes I use for running and walking.\n\nPerks:\n\n- Run a mile one minute faster than my average time.\n\n- Super Bouncy.\n\n- Look cool and feel fast.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Ankles always hurt when I use them.\n\n- Not helpful for improving the way I am naturally suppose to walk.\n\n- Feels unnatural.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZQbksWD25HF617t7rjb7yQ.png)\n\nPerks:\n\n- Favorite style shoe ever designed.\n\n- A happy medium between having some cushion but feeling natural.\n\n- Least painful shoe to run in and baseline for average mile time of 9 minutes when I run in these.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Not as fast as other shoes.\n\n- Horrible for basketball (no ankle support).\n\n- Takes a minute to break in so they feel just right and fit to your feet.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*UtHyPMa6NBFdFMEgQ8GdyA.png)\n\nPerks:\n\n- Most natural shoe that allows me to feel pain as my body intended.\n\n- Corrects my walk so I walk as a human is supposed to walk.\n\n- I like the color and fit.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- By far the most painful.\n\n- Takes a minute off my average mile time.\n\n- You feel rocks and the ground more which can be painful as you adjust to these shoes.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*3Kr4xr4uFL3MPlODikJmZg.jpeg)\n\n3/7/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
