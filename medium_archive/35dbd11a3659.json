  "content": "# Day 752\n\nToday I drove all the way to Fairhope Alabama for a wedding tomorrow. Getting to reconnect with old friends is so cool. It's crazy how after graduating college you go from seeing some of your best friends almost everyday to very rarely. I'm grateful that this weekend turned into a chance to hang out with my football buddies.\n\nI also saw that MassAdoption dropped their documentary and in it my daughter looks so adorable. Crazy how much she has grown since then.\n\n![[https://youtu.be/xWG3F-sull0?si=hL3aSduHBqhJLkEM](https://youtu.be/xWG3F-sull0?si=hL3aSduHBqhJLkEM)](https://miro.medium.com/1*agJGCpIaVpXR-W-3Imjt0A.png)\n\nTime flys. Cherish every minute. Life is a gift from God and I'm grateful he gave me mine. It's also important to remember that even in the hard times the best thing you can do is understand we are flawed creatures and never think you are better than someone. We all have our own journeys and being able to realize you don't know what someone else is going through is key to achieving a higher conscious.\n\n4/12/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
