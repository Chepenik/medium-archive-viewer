  "content": "# Day 801\n\nIf you want to keep power for life, make others dependant on you. This seems like a harsh rule. We all want to think there are people who like us for who we are. Yet, only your parents will love you for who you are. Everyone else is a self interested prick just trying to figure out what you can do for them.\n\nLearn this and you will remain powerful for your life. If a man can't provide for his family his partner will leave him. If a business associate stops making the firm money, see you later. If you become useless because you stop learning, good luck.\n\nThis is not all bad though. Learn this rule and make yourself needed. Your life will be one of more joy than misery. Humans are social beings and we need others. Plus, helping others feels good so be useful to others if you want to succeed more.\n\n5/31/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
