  "content": "# Day 412\n\nHad a mock interview today and it was great practice for the many to come. A big challenge with interviews is getting passed the nerves that interviews bring. If you think out loud, mention when you are going to go quite, and match the energy of the interviewer you will be fine. Probably worth going for a walk before the interview as well so the blood is flowing.\n\nAfter the interview I went and got to enjoy some sun in the Boston Commons. Just laid there in the grass listening to a podcast and soaking up sun. It was glorious and exactly what I needed to recharge. Don't underestimate the power of enjoying nature and sunlight. The best things in life are always free.\n\n5/8/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
