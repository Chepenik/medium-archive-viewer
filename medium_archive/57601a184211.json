  "content": "# Day 860\n\nIt is very hard not to get distracted by all the new shiny things out there. Especially because they are popping up left and right, especially in regards to software development.\n\n> [**Modern web applications in pure Python**](https://fastht.ml/)\n\nHowever, I came across this and it seems like a super easy way to build websites using Python. Excited to learn more about it.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FAuqrm7WFc0I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAuqrm7WFc0I&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FAuqrm7WFc0I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nAnyways, it is all just zeros and ones. True or false. 0 1. That is what the computer understands. We just make the code human readable so people can do things with the zeros and ones, like write this Medium. It's actually amazing they can make zeros and ones represent all of this stuff. Videos, blogs, social media, algorithm's to keep us addicted to social media, LLMs we can chat with and so much more! Soon enough an AI will be writing 99.9% of the code and humans will be steering the AI to optimize said code it writes. Stay humble and keep learning. It's an exciting time to be alive.\n\n![[https://primal.net/p/npub1a2cww4kn9wqte4ry70vyfwqyqvpswksna27rtxd8vty6c74era8sdcw83a](https://primal.net/p/npub1a2cww4kn9wqte4ry70vyfwqyqvpswksna27rtxd8vty6c74era8sdcw83a)](https://miro.medium.com/1*rL7yTf__XlLjveAx7sP9tA.png)\n\nAlso keep your ego in check!\n\n7/29/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
