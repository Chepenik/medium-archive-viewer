  "content": "# Day 1031\n\nI went to a comedy show tonight. Props to people who get up and crack jokes in front of other humans. It is much harder than it looks, especially to do good stand up.\n\nI enjoyed it. I don't agree with all the jokes, but it's so nice to be able to speak freely about things. Sure it's under the guise of comedy, but it's coming from a place of truth.\n\nIt's nice to be confronted with opinions you disagree with, and then realizing in the big scope of things that decision does not impact my life at all.\n\nLearn to be concerted when figuring out what to care about. The important things are few and far between.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*yA430M25tLgqezYjjBOCgg.png)\n\n1/16/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
