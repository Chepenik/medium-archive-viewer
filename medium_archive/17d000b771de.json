Our financial system is going to change drastically. On top of this we are witnessing a historic moment as Trump gets indicted in Georgia. It is the first mugshot of a former US president. He used the mugshot to garner support and honestly it seems like it will have a significant impact on his political future.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/HiRezTheRapper/status/1695155198920933508%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nTrump's supporters have already begun to use the mugshot as a fundraising tool, selling T-shirts and other merchandise with the image. This suggests that they are not taking the charges against him seriously, and that they believe he will be acquitted.\n\nOnly time will tell how these indictments will ultimately affect Trump's campaign for a second term. However, it is clear that it is a major development in a story that is still unfolding.\n\nWhen I think about what the Democrats are allowing it brings to mind the concept of \"f*** around and find out,\" where actions may lead to unintended consequences . This sentiment seems to echo through the current situation.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/rogerskaer/status/1576025818182332416%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nConsidering my own view, I tend to lean towards meritocracy as a more effective system of governance compared to democracy, although the latter is the prevailing structure.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*cUjBpibDH6QL5OSBqbYvkA.jpeg)\n\nThe arrest of a prominent candidate from an opposing party are the tactics of banana republics. While Trump's divisive nature has led to a multitude of opinions about him, it's noteworthy that his situation backfiring on the Democrats underscores the potential dangers of such actions. One can only hope that neither major party would repeat this scenario in the future. This incident sets a troubling precedent, and it appears that the American populace is expressing its disapproval for what it perceives as an unjust, politically motivated prosecution against a former U.S. President.\n\nYoutube read of this post:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_FCJmPGxlvE&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_FCJmPGxlvE&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n8/25/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
