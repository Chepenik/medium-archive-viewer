  "content": "# Day 1218\n\nSo many tabs, so many books, so many things I want to do. Yet, I let my mind wander. I go down the rabbit holes that interest me. I try to get better everyday, but give myself the grace I need when I fall short.\n\nDespite all these \"I\" statements, what truly matters runs deeper. Family stands at the center of everything. God blessed me with an extraordinary one. They serve as my rock, my foundation, the greatest gift life has offered me. Recognizing this divine blessing comes with responsibility: putting them first, always.\n\nTheir love deserves priority over every tab, every book, every distraction that pulls at my attention. In remembering this truth, scattered thoughts find their proper focus.\n\nToday I got to enjoy dinner with my daughter. She helped me cook, and we said grace shortly after eating. I forgot to say it before I started, but when I reminded Sloan that we should pray and I forgot to do so, she was happy to pray with me. It's amazing how little kids can get such joy out of the small things. She wanted to help me cook hamburgers and she did. Even though I did the bulk of the work it's so blissful to see a child excited to help.\n\nMoments like these remind me what truly deserves my attention. I have countless projects and ideas swirling in my mind, so many that I often freeze with analysis paralysis. But tonight's dinner became a gentle anchor, grounding me in what matters most and helping me tune out the noise.\n\nOf course, recognizing this truth is much easier than living it consistently. That's where grace comes in, the same grace I mentioned earlier. Perhaps I can use these writings as a way to focus my intentions. Tomorrow, I want to have an amazing date night with my wife. If I accomplish that, tomorrow will be a good day.\n\nI also want to keep exploring those fascinating rabbit holes. Learning something new each day brings its own kind of joy. Today I discovered the following:\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1947844131507884144](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1947844131507884144)](https://miro.medium.com/1*YFsjcEcaqAuiJfwU6UFARw.png)\n\nNow I kind of lowkey want to own one of these 100k bills. Even if I dislike Woodrow Wilson and the fact he signed the Federal Reserve into law. It would just make for a cool collectors item.\n\n7/22/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
