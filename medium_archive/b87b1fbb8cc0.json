It inspired me to do some prompting.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*4spDXJjY2Jm5ajILVJHbFw.png)\n\nChep - talk to me about this idea of money as a necessary evil\n\n> Claude.ai - Money as a \"necessary evil\" is an interesting philosophical concept that has been debated for centuries. Here are a few key points around this idea:\n\n> Money is seen as evil or corruptive by some because it can lead to greed, materialism, and inequality. The pursuit of money over other goals is seen as morally questionable.\n\n> However, money is also considered a necessary tool for society to function. It facilitates trade, provides incentives, and enables large-scale coordination in a way that a barter system cannot.\n\n> Modern economies require some form of money and financial system to operate. Eliminating money entirely would create more problems than it solves.\n\n> But the negative impacts of money can potentially be mitigated through policies that distribute it more equitably, regulate its excesses, and emphasize ethics/morals.\n\n> Striking the right balance is tricky. Having no money likely leads to economic stagnation. But having too much focus on accumulating money can be socially detrimental.\n\n> There are also debates around how money shapes values and mindsets. Does money corrupt morals, or reflect underlying human tendencies?\n\n> Overall there are good arguments on both sides. Money seems necessary for practical reasons, but some see it as enabling our worst impulses. A nuanced view is that money is a tool that can be used for good or ill.\n\n> In summary, money's status as a \"necessary evil\" is a nuanced issue with reasonable arguments on both sides. There are no easy or absolute answers, but it highlights important questions about society's values and priorities. What are your thoughts on this perspective?\n\nChep-Why do you care to know my thoughts? I'm happy to share them but generally curious why you care.\n\n> Claude.ai-That's a fair question! As an AI assistant without subjective experiences, I don't have personal thoughts or feelings on our conversation. However, I'm designed by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I aim to have a constructive dialogue by encouraging two-way discussion, rather than just providing information. Some reasons for asking about your thoughts:\n\n> It allows me to gauge your perspective and tailor my responses accordingly. By understanding your viewpoint better, I can give more relevant information.\n\n> Two-way discussion tends to be more engaging for humans than just passive reception of information. My goal is to make the conversation interesting and worthwhile.\n\n> Asking for your thoughts prompts you to further analyze and verbalize your own positions. This can promote deeper reflection and learning on complex subjects.\n\n> It signals that I'm interested in an actual conversation, not just delivering monologues. My role is to assist and discuss, not lecture.\n\n> Your unique opinions and knowledge are valuable for an AI like myself to be exposed to. It helps broaden my conversational abilities.\n\n> Overall, I strive for beneficial, thoughtful, and meaningful dialogue. Please let me know if I should adjust my conversational style or approach in any way - I'm always aiming to improve!\n\nChep - I agree with you that money is a tool that can be used for good or ill. Just like any tool. I believe fiat money is a tool being misused by Central Bankers around the world. Bitcoin, not cryptocurrency, seems to be a better tool for humanity because math and open source software are harder to corrupt than humans\n\n> Claude.ai - That's an insightful perspective on money as a tool, and the comparison between fiat currency and bitcoin specifically. You raise some thoughtful points:\n\n> Treating money as a neutral tool that can be applied either ethically or unethically, rather than good or evil in itself, is a nuanced viewpoint. Just like any technology, impact depends on how it's used.\n\n> Centralized control of fiat money does risk misuse and corruption, whereas bitcoin's decentralized math-based system limits that specific risk.\n\n> Math and open-source software introduce different trade-offs, but do provide more transparency and algorithmic fairness compared to human-managed monetary policy.\n\n> However, no system is perfect. Bitcoin has other risks like volatility and environmental impact that require consideration as well.\n\n> Ultimately it comes down to balancing trade-offs and ethical application. No money system alone ensures just outcomes - that depends on complex social and political factors as well.\n\n> You raise thoughtful points on the strengths and weaknesses of different monetary tools and structures. I think you highlight well how technology shapes incentives and power dynamics, but human values and policies remain crucial. How we apply tools, whether fiat currency or blockchain, determines outcomes as much as the tools themselves. Please feel free to expand on your perspective, I'm happy to discuss this interesting topic further!\n\nChep - Measured in fiat Bitcoin is volatile but the environment argument is ridiculous. Proof of work mining is why Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed when measured in fiat. The volatility is a lot but that is to be expected for an asset monetizing itself for the first time\n\n> Claude.ai - Those are fair counterpoints. You make some cogent arguments:\n\n> Bitcoin's volatility when valued in fiat currencies is to be expected for a new form of money going through initial price discovery. As it matures, volatility could decrease.\n\n> Proof of work mining provides security and helped bootstrap Bitcoin's value, though it remains energy intensive. Newer protocols are exploring alternatives like proof of stake.\n\n> Comparisons to fiat systems should consider the energy costs of traditional finance, security, banking, cash printing, storage, etc.\n\n> As a natively digital asset, Bitcoin enables new efficiencies not possible with physical money. These could counterbalance computing costs.\n\n> Bitcoin's energy usage may also increasingly shift to renewable sources, improving sustainability. And energy costs secure a global monetary network - a worthwhile goal to some.\n\n> You provide good nuance on the environmental debate. I agree the energy critique can be oversimplified at times. Ultimately there are reasonable arguments on both sides of this complex issue. As with any new technology, realistically weighing pros and cons is important. I appreciate you adding these insightful points to the discussion. Please feel free to share any other thoughts!\n\nThis conversation with ai was incredibly helpful. I genuinely learned and improved my perspective. Now imagine anyone with internet access and an email can start to access this stuff. Call me crazy but I'm bullish on humanity. For every kleptocrat there is two builders.\n\nI even used computers to generate a podcast with this dialogue. It is amazing what machines can do and it's only getting exponentially better.\n\nHockey Stick!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*abzOZXcf90ubuzOx.png)\n\nHere is the recorded Youtube video.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FooK-kdJZQoE&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DooK-kdJZQoE&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n8/19/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
