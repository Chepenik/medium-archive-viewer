  "content": "# Day 233\n\nI was cracking up on the subway listening to Matt Walsh shoot the bull with Joe Rogan. For those keen to listen here is the link.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed%2Fepisode%2F5c6SOd05MxXpPtFKqw4y1T%2Fvideo%3Futm_source%3Doembed&display_name=Spotify&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F5c6SOd05MxXpPtFKqw4y1T&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2Fab67656300005f1fbe1e72522a079591f672b8bc&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=spotify\" title=\"\" height=\"351\" width=\"624\"></iframe>\n\nThese guys debated ideas out in the open. No bullshit spin or mainstream media talking points. Just two guys trying to navigate this insane world where you can be fired if you \"misgender\" someone. I was cracking up on my train ride home from work when Matt Walsh was talking about how at college screenings of his film \"What Is A Woman?\" the people who disagree will stand outside the screening with signs and eat pages of the bible rather than come inside and try and debate the ideas after a screening. I mean think about how ridiculous that is. If you think someone is wrong debate them! Don't try and eat the bible. It's comical and sad. Ideas should be discussed freely. Intimidation and coercion are not the way to win over the masses.\n\nTruth will win.\n\nGood will win. Keep the faith.\n\n11/10/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
