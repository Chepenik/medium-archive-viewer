  "content": "# Day 598\n\nI'm already blown away by all the cool GPTs people have built. It is actually a bit much because I'm trying to keep up and there are just too many good ones.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1723071615510982670%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nOne system allows you to pick any two historical figures and have them engage in a nuanced debate on a topic of your choosing. I tested it out by asking John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek to discuss whether financial options trading benefits or harms markets overall. Their fake but convincing back-and-forth highlighted key aspects of each thinker's philosophy in an engaging way.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/BrianRoemmele/status/1722829814716158340%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis AI tool helps generate effective landing pages by providing iterative feedback as you design and tweak page elements. Within one minute, it had worked with me to craft a professional-looking page that would clearly communicate a tech company's value proposition if I updated it to include copy.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=http%3A//twitter.com/skirano/status/1723026269976088669%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nExperiencing these powerful new applications firsthand reinforces my belief that we're on the cusp of an AI-fueled revolution in how humans interact with computers. Much like the advent of the GUI radically changed accessibility to computers in the 1980s, transformer-based language models like GPT-4 seem poised to exponentially expand what's possible in terms of intuitive user experiences. I can only imagine where we'll be in tooling and capabilities one year from now. It's an extraordinarily exciting time, and I look forward to being part of this journey.\n\nIn other news...\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1723172921894412618%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI'll end this by noting that wrestling practice is absolutely kicking my behind and I'm super sore. GOOD! Adversity is necessary to thrive and I am amped up about helping these kids succeed. Going to be a fun year!!!!\n\n11/10/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
