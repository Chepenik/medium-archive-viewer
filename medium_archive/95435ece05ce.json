  "content": "# Day 494\n\nRecently I've set my phone on grey mode. I'm still addicted to the device, but I feel myself going through withdrawals as well. Gave me a headache at first using grey mode which has gone away with time. It makes me appreciate color more when I see it on other screens or devices. Nice to take a break from my phone screen so I can stare at laptop/monitor/television screens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*mB537WY8U4-uhEZoMI-DiQ.png)\n\nPart of me wants to get rid of screens in my home but I also love having screens. Today I caught myself telling my machine \"You're good computer.\" until I realized my voice to text wasn't onðŸ˜‚  My iPhone was probably still listening in the background anyways.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*mtGOltfJlCfve5hg)\n\nMy computer (plus the servers I can access via the internet with my computer) are good. Look at this photo. Also the one below in the tweet was partially AI generated with me changing the text around and adding some other stuff.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1685345623241789440%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nFeels good to create. I even made a Youtube video to teach people about jest testing. Check it out below.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fzob7xplHhA8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dzob7xplHhA8&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fzob7xplHhA8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nI've got a long way to go in terms of being a creator that can make a living from his work. Getting incrementally better through practice is the only way I'll get there. So we will keep creating. Then one day if I'm lucky I'll have both the computer science knowledge and video editing skills to make videos like this which are 10/10 if you get programming humor.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FHyWYpM_S-2c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHyWYpM_S-2c&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FHyWYpM_S-2c%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n7/29/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
