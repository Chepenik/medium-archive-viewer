  "content": "# Day 1148\n\n**What Are The Unknown Unknowns?**\n\nSeems like a stupid question, right? The answer is built into the question..._we don't know._\n\nBut that's the point.\n\nYou don't ask this question expecting a clean answer. You ask it to remind yourself of something more important: **the game can change at any moment**. And when the game changes, the rules do too.\n\nThink about this, for most of history one constant haunted humanity's relationship with wealth: no matter how you earned it, saved it, or stacked it, someone else could take it. Governments could tax it. Banks could seize it. Central planners could inflate it away.\n\nThat was the game.\n\nAnd then, something no one saw coming, an unknown unknown, presented itself.\n\nBitcoin.\n\nSuddenly, you could store value in a way that was outside the reach of any ruler, regulator, or reserve bank. It couldn't be inflated, confiscated, or censored. And it changed how humans store wealth, not just financially, but philosophically. If I can save in something I'm confident that my children's children's children can receive one day well I might just work a little harder, care a little more, really try to leave the world a better place than I found it.\n\nIt was as if a new piece had entered the board. Something so new, so unprecedented, that the rules of the old game stopped making sense. And now, everyone still playing the old game looks confused, scrambling to fix problems that Bitcoin simply obsoletes.\n\nThe lesson? Unknown unknowns don't just surprise you they rewrite the map. They expand the boundaries of what's possible. When an unknown unknown appears, your models fail. But that's not a reason to fear it's a reason to grow.\n\nForever, we lived in a world where the institutions with the most power also controlled the money. Through mechanisms like central banking, they shaped economies in secret. They used monetary policy as a smoke screen, lowering or raising interest rates while quietly concentrating wealth and power. The booms and busts, the asset bubbles, the bailouts, they weren't bugs. They were features of the system for those at the top.\n\nThe rules were never fair. The incentives were warped. And most of us were just trying to make it through the maze without realizing the maze was rigged.\n\nBitcoin changed that. And because it did, _you should adapt how you play the game._ In the old paradigm, a small group of central bankers set the most important price in the world: the price of money. They met in secret, used economic models built on faulty assumptions, and claimed godlike control over something no one can truly master: time, human behavior, and complexity.\n\nBut the insight of decentralization, the insight behind Bitcoin, is that knowledge doesn't live at the top. It lives on the ground. With the people, the entrepreneurs, the farmers, the coders, and the parents living in reality. Not the bureaucrats theorizing in echo chambers and ivory towers.\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin powerful isn't just math, it is how it distributes decision-making. The same principle that made Prussia's army nimble, rebuilt Germany's economy, and fueled rapid growth in Japan, China, and the United States across various points in history: subsidiarity. Push power to the edge. Trust the people closest to the problem.\n\nThat's what central banks fear. Not volatility. Not inflation. Not recession. What they truly fear is _irrelevance_. You don't need to predict the future to thrive in it. You just need to be humble enough to accept that you don't know what you don't know. Trying to central plan the money for 8 billion people is guranteed to end in a train wreck. Pun intended as nothing stops this fiscal train from imploding since fiat currency is a textbook ponzi scheme.\n\nBitcoin wasn't obvious in 2009. It was an unknown unknown. So was the Internet in 1990. So was electricity, the printing press, penicillin. All were dismissed. All were underestimated. All changed the game.\n\nSo be ready.\n\nLearn to spot the edge of your own map. Learn to challenge your assumptions. Learn to trust the signal in your gut when something new arrives that doesn't make sense but won't go away.\n\nSometimes, the best investments you'll ever make aren't in assets, but in _seeing clearly_ when everyone else is still playing by broken rules.\n\nFlow with the new game.\n\n![The rules of the game ar ah changing baby!!!!:D](https://miro.medium.com/1*u7MjI5uUydjDvWvIjEkV0w.png)\n\n5/13/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
