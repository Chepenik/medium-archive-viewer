  "content": "# Day 353\n\nIt blows my mind how good South Park has remained over the years. Every time I watch that show I crack up. They put out an episode called Deep Learning that perfectly reflects how society will use chatGPT. Obviously, I do think it's an amazing tool. It's also easy to outsource all your work to chatGPT and end up with a bunch of unforeseen consequences. While I hope people can use the tool responsibily South Park offers a more realistic glimpse of what might happen.\n\nOn another note Silicon Valley Bank closed their doors today. Will we see more contagion in the future?\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/gromepow/status/1634257902734307328%3Fs%3D42%26t%3D4Tdo4A0e440FImHi_xnOgw&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nIf I had to guess...yes. Jim Cramer talking about one of the largest banks being a fortress doesn't install much confidence.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1634222320398086145%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nGradually then suddenly. Saw a lot about companies who held billions of funds at Silicon Valley Bank including the stable coin issuer Circle. They were not the only one holding a lot of funds at SVB. Roku was also holding around 26% of their cash with SVB. It sounds like a lot of dead fishes are going to be floating up to the surface in the near future.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1634326121998331904%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3D4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*So6E86gFdTXPHA80)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/JoeConsorti/status/1634393007389589508%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nCrazy times. Focus on the positives in your life. For me I am glad I had the chance to play basketball with some friends today. Also glad I hold Bitcoin. Stay safe out there anon. Bumpy times ahead but I'm confident chatGPT can help us figure out the way forward.ðŸ˜‚\n\n3/10/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
