  "content": "# Day 681\n\nToday, I had the pleasure of joining several of my new colleagues for dinner. It was incredibly exciting to connect with fellow Bitcoin enthusiasts. A special thanks to Swan for generously covering the meal. I'm truly impressed by the caliber of individuals at this company and feel privileged to be part of such a remarkable team.\n\nAdmittedly, I was not in the best spirits earlier today. Yet, the experience of spending time with such an amazing group of people was utterly transformative. Their energy and enthusiasm significantly improved my mood.\n\nThe reason I did not feel great earlier in the the day was because I kept thinking about that documentary Europa The Last Battle. On the one hand I love learning and questioning my beliefs. On the other hand, I see why people say ignorance is bliss.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Na6EL9PIYrzbVPPllvoLeQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*ICi1mpfoACsW00a9X-m_Iw.png)\n\nThere is only so much we can control in this life. Choose wisely where you give your f***s or you will never feel good!\n\n2/1/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
