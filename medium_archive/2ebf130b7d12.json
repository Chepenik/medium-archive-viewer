  "content": "# Day 852\n\nToday was one of those nights (what a way to start a sentence lol) where I lay down, plan to get up, then fall asleep. Naturally my body knows when a Medium is due so it wakes me up and I come out here to write. However, I'm ready to go back to bed.\n\nThank you body for the reminder; the streak lives on!\n\n7/21/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
