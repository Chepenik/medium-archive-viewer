  "content": "# Day 415\n\nGot to spend time with family today which was nice. Especially after a long day of struggling with some Javascript trying to get upvotes and downvotes buttons working in my HearSay app. Coding can be frustrating but I've come along way and when you figure something out after struggling it is so rewarding.\n\nI met with Kevin Rooke yesterday to discuss Stacker News and enjoyed the conversation. I'm a huge fan of these value 4 value platforms and hope to see more and more Bitcoiners use them. If you haven't used Stacker News check it out.\n\n[https://stacker.news/r/Chep](https://stacker.news/r/Chep)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*MabeokgQT5F5YCYNdPJK-w.png)\n\nIt's getting nice and warm up in Boston. Sitting in the Boston Commons, touching grass, and enjoying a good podcast has been my lunch time routine for the past 2 months. Here is to two more weeks of coding bootcamp and being a public park enjoyer.\n\nCheers anon.\n\n5/11/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
