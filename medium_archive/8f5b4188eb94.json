  "content": "# Day 725\n\nToday I went to TPC with my family. It was really cool getting to watch some pro golfers, drink over priced beer for free (shout out my boy for hooking me up with the Bank Of America suite tickets), and getting to touch some of the nicest grass in Florida. Almost bought a dope polo, but dropping $100 + cuck bucks for a polo when I already have so many seemed unwise.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*1nTD9Ej2RB9LKBwJhAbCqw.png)\n\nThe day was exceptional, not just for the sports but for the unexpected moments: a photographer captured our joy, hinting that our faces might grace the pages of a newspaper. He approached us, inquiring about our names, adding a touch of fame to the day. I'm looking forward to seeing if we make it in the newspaper.\n\nReflecting on these moments, I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for life's generous offerings.\n\n3/16/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
