  "content": "# Day 1208\n\nStarted the day early taking my Dad to the airport, then came back to tackle the lawn before recording a podcast. Squeezed in 9 holes of golf afterward, rushed home for a quick shower, and headed right back out for dinner with my Daughter and the Grandparents. Safe to say it's been non-stop and I'm ready to call it a night.\n\n> **Psalm 118:24 (KJV)**\n _\"This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.\"_\n\nToday, like all days, was a gift from God.\n\n7/12/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
