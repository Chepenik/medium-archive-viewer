  "content": "# Day 259\n\nToday has been a rough day. Had a dog walk go horribly wrong because the dog got off the leash while I was walking him. Spent around 4 hours looking for this dog to no avail. Only silver lining is I got over 25,000 steps in today but I feel horrible about the worst dog walking I've done in my entire career of dog walking. Praying the dog is found and returned safely to it's owner.\n\nAlso heard today from a great friend who might have cancer. That one was a gut punch to hear. I'm so proud of them for keeping their head up high and approaching it with a can-do attitude but man oh man. What a wild thing to happen at such a young age. Big wake up call for me to make sure I spend my days doing work I don't dread and focus on my health.\n\nDay's like today are tough, life is full of good and bad times. Going to say a prayer the dog gets returned safely. Will also pray for my friend to be cancer free, they are a fighter so I'm confident they will pull through.\n\nDon't have much else to write today. I can't change the past but I will keep my head high no matter the hardships. Tomorrow is going to be a better day.\n\n12/6/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
