  "content": "# Day 438\n\nI must say Pubkey was an incredible bar. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is a Bitcoiner. Paying for my beer and food with bitcoin felt so cool. They don't force it and fiat payment is the default but paying with bitcoin is equally seamless. Especially if you're using lightning, the payment is so fast. You just ask the bartender to ring you up with bitcoin and they present you with a QR code.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*PaBFoBlIVzhz7COrjiyU5w.jpeg)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1664791653737963522%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nNotice how I popped the opener on my can. I don't know why but I always do that. A tick of mine.\n\nI'll say this morning I was feeling pretty rough. Drank way more beers than I usually do. My body was not ready for that. So naturally I got up and went for a short run. Sweated out straight liquor but it was well worth it because last night was so fun. Between that run and the glasses of water I've been chugging down this morning my body feels much better. Tonight I'm going to a flux pavilion concert on the hudson river. You know NYC has it's issues and it would be tough to live in such a crowded city, for me personally anyways, but damn. This place is so cool! I like how my boy is living. He has a nice place in Weehawken so it's super easy to get to NYC but it's not as busy as actually living in manhattan. Plus, the view from Weehawken is also incredible.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1664988641121247232%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI'll leave you with this amazing video.
