  "content": "# Day 463\n\nReturning to Florida brings a sense of joy and nostalgia. This state, my childhood home, holds an irreplaceable spot in my heart. Today, I had the opportunity to visit the beach, where the scorching heat seemed to defy all reason. Despite the sweltering temperatures, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Additionally, I treated myself to a refreshing haircut this morning, and the feeling of looking in the mirror afterwards was incredibly satisfying. A vain thought, but one I genuinely had.\n\nLife finds its truest meaning in the smallest of treasures. The ability to spend quality time with my family, witnessing the radiant smile of my child as she embraces her grandparents, aunts, great-grandparents, and the entire extended family in between, is a truly special experience. One that provides a feeling which words will never be able to fully articulate. Additionally, the delight of savoring homemade meals brings an unparalleled sense of contentment. While the uncertainty of the future looms before me, I sense a compelling pull to return to the comforting embrace of Florida.\n\nOn the other hand, a part of me yearns to remain in the vibrant atmosphere of Boston. As I apply for jobs across the United States, I remain open to the possibility of embarking on a new adventure in a completely unfamiliar place. We shall see what happens. I hold steadfast in the belief that a divine plan awaits me, and I eagerly anticipate the unfolding of that plan, trusting in the guidance of God.\n\n> [**Day 24**](https://blog.okungfast.com/day-24/)\n\nThis blog post is worth the read but if you don't feel like clicking here is the TL;DR from chatGPT. \"Prayer is about building a relationship with God through connection and communication. Exploring the language of the Hebrew Torah reveals the word \"hitpallel\" (התפלל), which originally meant \"judging or walking within oneself.\" Rather than solely asking for help, prayer is a sacred act of self-reflection and self-assessment. The world extends beyond oneself, and growth comes from embracing this understanding and humbly evaluating oneself. When praying, choose a position that helps you focus, as the Creator hears you regardless of the physical posture.\"\n\nWalk more, move more, get out and exercise. Pray to God and realize that a higher power is within all of us. I know it can be hard going through your day to day dealing with the challenges of modern life, but rejoice because we get to experience the divine every time we reflect and show gratitude through prayer. I appreciate Okung saying he will pray for me at the end of that post and as I finish typing these words I will say a prayer for whichever kind soul stumbles upon this work one day. Breath in for 3 seconds, hold your breath for 3 seconds, and exhale for 3 seconds. Then repeat 3–7 more times. It's all going to work out great because you are loved, I love you anon.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*pHSAukecrks4t20XMFNgRQ.png)\n\n6/28/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
