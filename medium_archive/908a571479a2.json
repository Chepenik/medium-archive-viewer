  "content": "# Day 1128\n\n**Chapter 2: What Is Money?**\n\nMoney is one of the most important technologies humanity has ever created.\n\nNot because it's flashy, or new, or complex but because it touches everything. Every dream, every deal, every decision. If language lets us share thoughts, money lets us share value.\n\nIt's the clearest map of where people stand. Of what they value, what they need, and what they're willing to trade to get it.\n\nMoney is how strangers cooperate. It's how nations compete. It's how civilizations scale.\n\nThrough money, we measure worth, store energy, and transfer trust across time and space. It's a tool of incredible precision and also incredible power.\n\nMost of the time, money bends to the laws of the land. Sometimes money bends the law of the land. But once in a while, a new form of money emerges that rewrites those laws completely. It doesn't ask permission. It simply works better. And the world adapts.\n\nAt its most basic, money has three jobs: it helps people trade (medium of exchange), it holds its value over time (store of value), and it lets us measure things (unit of account). That's the textbook version.\n\nBut here's what the textbooks won't say: not all money is created equal.\n\nCigarettes can be money in prison but that doesn't make them good money. It just makes them the best available option in a system of forced scarcity and broken incentives. They work because nothing else does.\n\nOn a global scale, though, we need something better. Something reliable. Something neutral.\n\nGood money should be like Switzerland: neutral, accessible, and unaligned. It shouldn't care where you're from, what you believe, or who's in charge. It should be a common ground, not a control mechanism.\n\nMost forms of money in history have failed this test. Some were too easy to inflate. Others too easy to confiscate. Some served kings. Some served banks. Some served no one at all.\n\nBut the best money? The best money serves everyone.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that's what Satoshi created.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*rE5xlz7QXudT2r6Y3n3kgg.png)\n\n4/23/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
