Crushed a 3-mile run non-stop, felt exhausted the whole way but seeing my friend run nonstop made me run nonstop. Post-run, fired up the grill for a proper feast. Steaks, chicken, and onions topped off with way too many cookies and milk for dessert. No regrets though. Capped the night with a killer episode of Kill Tony. Laughed so hard my abs got a second workout. Comedy, sweat, and solid company. Can't beat life's simple pleasures :)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_ZsN6tkpMQQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_ZsN6tkpMQQ&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_ZsN6tkpMQQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n8/22/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
