  "content": "# Day 927\n\nAs I write this my child is asleep in my arms. On the one hand I was annoyed she kept coming out of our bedroom and refused to fall asleep without me. In the beginning it was only Mama who could put her to sleep. Now my lilLady is becoming a bit of a Daddy's girl at night. It's late and I still need to read my chapter, and I just finished my daily coding lesson before starting this.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1842396630177218692](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1842396630177218692)](https://miro.medium.com/1*PPHxdiGHeecbakKH81zZTQ.png)\n\nHowever, I'm glad she did. I know one day she won't be asking for me to tuck her in. She will soon be too large for her to fall asleep on me, or at least too large for me to type while she rests on my chest. I got a little emotional today because it dawned on me that before I know it she'll be all grown up. My wife sent me this and it resonated.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Wa7M-pb9rwGVVxOZgndi4g.png)\n\nI then ended up wasting time clicking around IG and came across this picture. Hahahaha she's already bigger and has more hair. Really is crazy how fast the time flies.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*S4oz11eiuELvSWZ6u4tywQ.png)\n\nIf/when you ever read this one day I hope you know I love you more than anything in this world Sloan Marie Chepenik. You are the best daughter a Dad could ask for and I thank God every day he brought you into my life. You have been such a blessing for your Mother and me and I could not imagine life without you.\n\nMy princess.\n\n10/4/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
