While I spend my days in the Bitcoin industry tapping out emails and digital code, it's the moments when I'm working with my hands that ignite a deeper satisfaction in my soul - even if those moments occasionally result in some questionably installed door locks.\n\nTake my first attempt at installing a door lock: picture a lock that was comically too small for the door, held somewhat precariously in place by an improvised rubber solution that would make any master craftsman wince. It's a testament to the gap between enthusiasm and expertise, and I'm eternally grateful that my father's team stepped in today to install a proper one. Sometimes the best DIY lessons start with humble (or humbling) beginnings.\n\nToday, as I helped - and I use that term loosely - install ceiling fans alongside my father and his team, I found myself reflecting on this divide. While they handled the heavy lifting, I managed smaller tasks like mounting brackets for remote controls. And you know what? Even those minimal contributions felt rewarding. Each turn of the screwdriver connected me to something real, something tangible. It wasn't just about adding value to the house - it was about the visceral pride of physical creation, no matter how small the task.\n\nThe irony isn't lost on me that jobs centered around sending emails often command higher salaries than those held by the people who literally build our world. Yes, some skilled trades - electricians, plumbers, HVAC professionals - earn excellent money, but our society seems to place a premium on digital labor over physical craftsmanship. Yet I can't remember the last time hitting \"send\" on an email filled me with the same rush of accomplishment as stepping back from a freshly installed door handle, knowing I had shaped my environment with my own hands - even if that shaping occasionally needs professional correction.\n\nEven software development, which I deeply respect, exists in a different realm. While coding involves crafting complex systems from scratch, it lacks the sensory richness of physical labor - the aromatic bite of sawdust, the tactile feedback of a well-worn tool, the immediate visibility of progress. That said, I've recently discovered a fascinating middle ground: 3D printing. There's something magical about watching lines of code and whirring hardware transform simple PLA filament into tangible objects. It's where my digital world meets the physical one, creating a bridge between bits and atoms that feels like the best of both worlds.\n\nSocial media stands even further removed from meaningful creation. While it may deliver quick hits of dopamine, these fleeting moments feel hollow compared to the deep satisfaction of craftsmanship. Instead of building something lasting, we scroll through an endless stream of ephemeral content, each moment distracting us from real, tangible accomplishment.\n\nThe people who physically build and maintain our world - the ones who sweat, strain, and shape reality with their hands - they're the ones who truly understand the soul-deep satisfaction of creation. Their work isn't just about earning a paycheck; it's about leaving an indelible mark on the physical world. Every structure that shelters us, every system that keeps us comfortable, every piece of infrastructure that supports our daily lives - these are monuments to the dignity and importance of manual labor.\n\nAs someone deeply embedded in the digital world, I find myself increasingly drawn to developing my analog skills. Whether it's my amateur attempts at home improvement or the hybrid world of 3D printing, each step into the physical realm reminds me of what we risk losing in our rush toward all things digital. When I look at something I've built or repaired with my own hands - even if it's not perfect - there's a profound sense of connection that no digital achievement can match. It's a reminder that despite our increasingly virtual world, we are still physical beings who find our deepest satisfaction in tangible creation. That's the true power of working with your hands - it grounds us in reality and connects us to the ancient human tradition of making real things that last, whether those things are expertly crafted or held together with rubber and hope.\n\n10/25/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
