Who, in their right mind, would be tempted by the thought of nuclear war? Surely, only those who harbor a desire to destroy humanity. I genuinely hope more world leaders have children - it might instill in them a deeper sense of responsibility for the future.\n\nWhen leaders have a personal stake in tomorrow, like their own kids, they're more likely to commit to building a better, safer world. The legacy they leave behind, especially in a world where nuclear weapons exist, should drive them to be more cautious and deliberate in their decisions.\n\nNuclear war should never be seen as a strategic option; it's too dangerous to even consider normalizing. The responsibility world leaders bear isn't just for their own nations but for the survival of all humanity. The stakes are far too high to take lightly.\n\n![[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sean-mcnamara-bitesize-bitcoin_activity-7236831080786337792-Q-A7](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sean-mcnamara-bitesize-bitcoin_activity-7236831080786337792-Q-A7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)](https://miro.medium.com/1*rA1fU_WuDy2jUWTzmHqtQw.png)\n\nGovernments are of course extreme creatures...\n\n9/3/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
