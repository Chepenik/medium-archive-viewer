As someone who's never been particularly politically inclined, I find it striking that one President is evading bullets while the other avoids even the most basic cognitive assessments. It's unprecedented to witness a President's life being threatened during my lifetime. May God bless America, a nation that sorely needs it right now.\n\n7/13/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
