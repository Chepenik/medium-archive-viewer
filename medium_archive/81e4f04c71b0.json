  "content": "# Day 312\n\n**I'm On Team Bitcoin**\n\nBeing part of a team, whether it be playing a sport or participating in a decentralized financial system like Bitcoin, is a valuable experience. As a matter of fact, playing football for 11 years helped me see the value in Bitcoin when I was first introduced to it in 2017. Like most, I was tempted to venture away from Bitcoin only and start dabbling in other cryptocurrencies because, as any wanna-be investor knows, \"diversification is key.\" Ironically enough, it wasn't until I hung up my football cleats three years later that I fully understood why Bitcoin is completely different from the rest of the space. I was looking for something to fill the void left in my heart after my football career was over, so I started spending more time in the Bitcoin space. Games and sports provide a way for individuals to unwind, relieve stress, improve cognitive function, and foster social connections. Without my favorite game, I was lost. Football helped me get an education at a solid university, it helped me make some of the best friends I still have today, and it helped me avoid obesity, which, as someone who is a glutton for good food, is no easy feat. I've found going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole has done all of those things and then some. For example, I've started learning how to code, I've met tons of new friends online and in-person, I've become more religious, I started a family, and I've even tried fasting, which I've found to provide a variety of benefits including increased focus. It's weird to think that computer code can have such a profound impact on both individuals and civilization as a whole. Bitcoin brings together people from around the world to work towards a common goal of a decentralized financial system. This is the key, because, as Henry Kissinger said,\n\n> Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the energy can control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.\n\nI've found Bitcoin to be a bit of a paradox in the sense the community is both global and inclusive, and local and exclusive. As someone who has been a part of many different teams, Team Bitcoin is unlike any team I've ever been on. Anyone can run a Bitcoin node with an old laptop to send and receive transactions. At the same time, if you venture into Bitcoin twitter and start talking about alt-coins in the wrong circles, you will quickly get to experience the wrath of the [cyber hornets](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/are-bitcoiners-aholes). The way I think about my journey in the crypto space is like moving from the junior varsity team to the varsity team. I started off on the JV, super excited and ill-prepared to compete. But after 5 years of hard work and research, I have finally joined the varsity team of Bitcoin Maximalists who can confidently articulate why Bitcoin is the true innovation and everything else is simply fiat 2.0. Similar to any varsity team, Bitcoiners have their own set of rules, level of commitment, and top players. It's not easy to fully understand and articulate the value of Bitcoin when the majority of the crypto space is being flooded with alternative coins and projects that are nothing more than vaporware tokens, pushed by grifters who are only able to capitalize on the hype and confusion of a zero interest rate environment. But, through perseverance and dedication, I have come to understand that only Bitcoin has the potential to truly change the world for the better, in a way that no other digital currency or token can match. The best varsity teams I was a part of not only excelled on the field, but also helped to develop and mentor the junior varsity team, ensuring that the program's success would continue for years to come as the JV players would be prepared to step up and take over the varsity team.\n\nOne of the great things about football is that no matter how many championships you win, there is always another one to go after in the next season. Just look at Tom Brady, who has also fallen victim to the broader crypto space. Tom has won numerous championships in football and yet still strives to win more. I remain hopeful that if he ever decides to hang up his cleats, he can learn from his mistakes and see that Bitcoin only is the way. The reason I bring this up is because there are many people who saw the innovation of Bitcoin early, made a lot of money, and then fell victim to alt-coins. Some people may be too far gone to save, but for those who haven't yet put in the effort to understand the differences between Bitcoin and other crypto assets, I implore you to do so. Being a part of the Bitcoin community is full of challenges and adversity, but it is also where some of the strongest friendships and bonds are forged. Choosing to be a Bitcoin maximalist allows you to wake up with a clear conscience. It's one thing to call yourself decentralized, and another thing to actually be a decentralized network. Experienced Bitcoiners have a responsibility to guide and educate new members of the community on their journey to understanding Bitcoin, and why it is the only coin decentralized enough to withstand nation-state attacks. It's important to remember that Bitcoin's bottom-up approach empowers individuals to make their own choices and decisions. With the increasing availability of educational resources, it's becoming easier for people to learn about Bitcoin, and it's important to keep repeating the message that Bitcoin maximalism is the most virtuous position.\n\nWhen you are playing a team sport it is fair to say that a team is only as strong as its weakest player. However, in the crypto community that might be a bit of stretch to say considering this space attracts both the best and brightest as well as the most despicable degenerates. If Bitcoin is going to break away from crypto we need to come together as a team and help our most under-educated members realize that perception and reality are starkly different.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/GetBittr/status/1593573892060332032%3Fs%3D20%26t%3DbjOlJxWbY6v5kZGx6Ywx5A&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nIf Bitcoin is going to become the next world reserve currency Bitcoiners must continue lifting up our weakest links. That doesn't mean we kept people on the team who aren't willing to put in the work. It means those who have shown they are committed should be lifted up while the ones hanging around for the clout and \"ma gains bro\" who are not willing to work get kicked to the side. At some point the junior varsity is going to be running the show. It's not a perfect metaphor but that's how I look at alt-coin holders who need to do more work to understand the Bitcoin Maximalist philosophy.\n\nIf we are going to get to the planet on a Bitcoin standard it is going to involve a whole bunch of proof of work, both literally and figuratively. I was fortunate enough to attend a Bitcoin dinner for[ Mass Adoption](http://massadoption.net/) and at that dinner everyone went around the table talking about their experience with Bitcoin. Someone brought up an amazing Odell quote that goes \"I'm bullish on Bitcoin but more bullish on Bitcoiners\". I can't think of a better way to frame it. Regardless of what happens with the price of Bitcoin, the friendships and connections I've made through this digital currency will always hold value. When it was my[ turn](https://youtu.be/AJrFNsNElUA?t=1719) to present I talked about my 11 years of football and the hole I felt in my heart after hanging up the cleats. I had no idea doing a legitimate deep dive into Bitcoin would fill that hole and then some. Going to meetups in my area and meeting like minded individuals was cathartic. I've made a whole new set of friends who I know are willing to go to battle with me. I'll never stop laughing about how a single white paper has had such a profound impact on the lives of those who have embraced this new form of money.\n\nThis is my personal anecdotal experience so don't trust me; go verify for yourself. With that disclaimer I can confidently say I've seen Bitcoiners to be more invested in the growth and success of their community members, than in the success of the technology itself. Which is not to say that we aren't invested in making sure the technology succeeds. Bitcoin just helps you realize that the most important things in life don't necessarily come from having a certain amount of wealth. Bitcoiners care deeply about fixing the world, about educating others, and about righting the wrongs that are becoming more and more apparent by the day. Many, myself included, came to Bitcoin because number go up and while I can't speak for everyone I'll say the reason I stayed is because I believe with every fiber of my being that Bitcoin is the best hope humanity has to fix the world.\n\nOf course, the transition is far from over and the mainstream media will never stop painting Bitcoin as either dead or a bubble. It will take a whole new set of media outlets filled with Bitcoiners who understand the potential for true decentralization and the benefits it brings. I'm confident these outlets will end up replacing the old outlets soon enough. In a bull market, many new participants join the community, and the true Bitcoiners know that many of these \"JV players\" are not yet ready to fully understand and embrace the true potential of Bitcoin. So whatever happens let's remain patient, teach those who have sinned with their shitcoins, and ignore those who are beyond saving. Bitcoin is not just a new form of money, it's a community of individuals who strive for self-sovereignty, savings, and a better future. It's a team worth being a part of.\n\nSo far in 2023 we've seen what looks to be the start of another bull market. I can confidently say after being humbled through two cycles I have absolutely no idea which was the direction of this coin is going in USD purchasing power terms. What I do know is that when bitcoin is in it's dead phase you don't see as many \"JV players\" coming to celebrate with the true Bitcoiners. At least not until the next bull market. So if this is a fake pump remember the bear market is a great time to build. Bitcoiners are a unique breed of people and the bear market is the time when you find your team, start writing, coding, podcasting, hosting a Bitcoin meetup, or whatever else floats your boat. If it turns out this is the start of the next bull market then do all these things and remember to stay humble. Some would call Bitcoin a mind virus because those who go down the rabbit hole can't stop talking about. I'd argue Bitcoin is the antidote to the problems of fiat currency. Those on the team understand this and that's why they're all in. Bitcoiners start taking more self-sovereignty, save more, create value, and work towards a better future. I've been on a lot of teams throughout my life and I'm grateful I found team bitcoin to help make sure I don't give into the nihilism team fiat is poisoning the world with.\n\n— - -\n\nNeed another day to feel like this is ready to submit but I'm making solid progress.\n\nEnjoyed writing this Twitter thread about AI today. I also enjoyed the taylor ham egg and cheese bagel I had this morning after fasting all Friday.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1619416923586056192%3Fs%3D20%26t%3D-xsUb5dFXdXqIjLzR1oLaA&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI stuffed my face at dinner tonight and it reminded me that fasting is honestly less painful than that feeling after stuffing your face. Food is amazing, but overdoing it sucks. You live and learn.\n\nAnyways, I plan to get away from making all these posts about articles I'm writing. I'm just eager to get another article posted in Bitcoin Magazine and sometimes writing an article and then writing these Mediums leaves me feeling like I got writers block. GOOD THAT MEANS A CHALLENGE TO OVERCOME. Plus with AI I can prompt it to give me some themes to write about and boom we are off to the races. Keep creating anon! The World needs more of us :)\n\n1/28/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
