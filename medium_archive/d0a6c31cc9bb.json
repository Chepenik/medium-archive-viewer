  "content": "# Day 1213\n\nAnother day signifying I've been on this planet for another year. Crazy how fast times goes by as you get older. Had a nice steak dinner tonight at Stonewoods. Grateful I got to celebrate with my family and loves ones. God is good.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to show my team at work how to build an app from scratch using Replit. I need to brainstorm what I will build so tonight that's what this post is going to be about. Decided to enlist AI's help and this is the Prompt I will use in Replit tomorrow:\n\n> **🚀  Project: Bitcoin Blaster - Ultra‑Addictive Laser Runner**\n\n> **Goal:** In **one go**, produce a single‑file HTML5 Canvas + vanilla JS game that hooks players instantly, \"one more run\" after every action.\n\n> 1. Project Setup\n\n> **Single HTML**\n\n> Embed all CSS and JS into `index.html`.\n\n> **Canvas Initialization**\n\n> `<canvas id=\"game\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"></canvas>`\n\n> Auto‑scale to window while preserving aspect ratio.\n\n> **Asset Placeholders**\n\n> Simple geometry + text (no external assets).\n\n> Define colors/gradients up top:\n\n> `const COLORS = { bg: '#000011', neonBlue: '#0ff', neonOrange: '#f80', gold: '#fc0', red: '#f00', purple: '#909' };`\n\n> 2. Loading Screen\n\n> **Structure:** Full‑screen dark overlay + centered spinning ₿ + \"CLICK TO MINE\" button\n\n> **Animation:**\n\n> Rotate `₿` continuously.\n\n> Pulse button glow.\n\n> **Interaction:**\n\n> On click: fade‑out overlay, start game loop.\n\n> 3. Core Loop & Player\n\n> **Game States:**\n\n> `LOADING → PLAYING → GAMEOVER`\n\n> **Player Object:**\n\n> `const player = { lane: 1, // 0,1,2 xPositions: [80,240,400], y: 550, width: 60, height: 60, energy: 100, lives: 3, speed: 0, drift: 0.2 };`\n\n> **Controls:**\n\n> **A/D** or **←/→** → `player.lane = clamp(lane ±1)`\n\n> Smooth interpolation: `player.x += (targetX - player.x) * drift`.\n\n> **SPACE** → `fireLaser()`; hold → auto‑fire at `fireRate` until `energy == 0`.\n\n> 4. Entities & Mechanics\n\n> **Collectibles**\n\n> **Sat** orb: +10 score, +15 energy (cap at 100)\n\n> **Whale** coin (1% chance): +50 score, full‑screen flash\n\n> **Obstacles**\n\n> **FUD** block: destroyable, +5 points\n\n> **Spike**: instant death on collision\n\n> **Laser**\n\n> Energy cost: `1` per shot; recharge `+0.1` per frame or via sats\n\n> Render as bright line with muzzle flash\n\n> **Combo & Speed**\n\n> Track `comboCount`, reset after 1s of no hit\n\n> Multiplier: `1 + floor(comboCount / 3)` up to ×5\n\n> Increase scroll speed every 200 points\n\n> 5. Rendering & VFX\n\n> **Background:** Scrolling grid of faint ₿ symbols in parallax\n\n> **Player:**\n\n> Rotate/tilt sprite based on lane changes\n\n> Laser muzzle: brief circle + flash outline\n\n> **Particles:**\n\n> On coin/obstacle destroy: spawn 10–20 particles, fade & shrink\n\n> **Screen Shake:** 1–5px on death or near miss\n\n> **UI:**\n\n> Score: large top‑left, \"+n\" pop‑ups at impact\n\n> Energy bar: neon outline + fill\n\n> Lives: gold hearts at top‑right\n\n> 6. Audio Hooks\n\n> Search the web for the easiest way to do this and have the sounds preload minimal base64 SFX\n\n> Looping synthwave via a free API or solution you find when searching the web\n\n> SFX triggers:\n\n> Laser → randomize pitch ±10%\n\n> Coin → \"ding\"\n\n> Explosion → \"boom\"\n\n> Combo → rising \"whoosh\"\n\n> Low life → heartbeat loop when `lives === 1`\n\n> Mute toggle on **M** key\n\n> 7. Game Over & Retry\n\n> **Explosion animation** centered on player, then overlay \"GAME OVER\"\n\n> Typewriter reveal of final score + \"SO CLOSE!\" or \"BITCOIN LEGEND!\"\n\n> Show \"SPACE = RETRY\" button; on press, reset all state with **no reload**\n\n> 8. Persistence & Leaderboard\n\n> Use `localStorage` for:\n\n> `highScore`\n\n> `lastPlayerName:` prompt at first game over\n\n> Display high score on loading screen as \"Beat the legend: X pts\"\n\n> 9. Performance & Polish\n\n> **60 FPS** target - batch draw calls, reuse particle objects\n\n> **All logic + render** in two loops:\n\n> `function update(dt) { /* move, collision, spawn, score */ } function draw() { /* clear, background, entities, UI */ } requestAnimationFrame(loop);`\n\n> Keep total lines ≲500 if possible\n\n> **— Agent, one‑shot this:**\n\n> **Write HTML skeleton** with embedded `<style>` and `<script>`.\n\n> **Implement loading screen** and transition.\n\n> **Build core classes**: `Player`, `EntityManager` (spawn, update, draw).\n\n> **Add controls, laser system, collision detection.**\n\n> **Layer on collectibles, obstacles, combos, speed ramp.**\n\n> **Add VFX: particles, screen‑shake, UI pop‑ups.**\n\n> **Integrate audio via Web Audio or free solution.**\n\n> **Implement GameOver & retry logic.**\n\n> **Hook up localStorage high score.**\n\n> **Optimize for smooth 60 FPS.**\n\n> Prioritize **instant gratification** - every input triggers satisfying visual/audio feedback. Make **Bitcoin Blaster** the ultimate \"just one more game\" experience.\n\nI did another version I had another AI write from scratch with HTML & JS and it made this:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*wmB9oVDpFdDLy3yLgg4toQ.png)\n\nExcited to see how it goes tomorrow when I ask the Replit's agent to make me this game from scratch live in front of my team. Exciting!\n\n7/17/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
