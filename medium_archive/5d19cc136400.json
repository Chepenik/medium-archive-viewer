  "content": "# Day 1098\n\nTonight after a wonderful family dinner, I was lounging with my father-in-law, my wife, and my buddy Travis. I brought up this hilarious Beeple artwork I'd seen on X (Twitter). I was dying laughing, but only Travis got it because he's the only other Twitter addict in the room. Everyone else just stared at me like I'd lost my mind.\n\n![[https://x.com/beeple/status/1904018379482054728](https://x.com/beeple/status/1904018379482054728)](https://miro.medium.com/1*s--MAg6OpSkOYrtcgVy9Iw.png)\n\nFor context this is what it refers to if you also don't use Twitter.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//x.com/tipsformenx/status/1902608673022595531&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nAnyways, it's a good reminder that Twitter is not real life. Funny though when you get the inside jokes. Another good one was the memes about Klarna and Doordash teaming up. That produced a gold mine of content.\n\n![[https://x.com/chasedownleads/status/1902785526186307734](https://x.com/chasedownleads/status/1902785526186307734)](https://miro.medium.com/1*LW86RZRJ5xVOdBL8edv0rw.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/AdamSinger/status/1902805429224448438](https://x.com/AdamSinger/status/1902805429224448438)](https://miro.medium.com/1*Vx0-NQQ4GjswDwOBjP87xQ.png)\n\n![[https://primal.net/e/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzp4qgk4dfevf2zvfsjkkvxdkuu9wk5hz77wj5p50vatmlh9l23ec2qqsw6xayfqaj3zqqut9txgcqr70vrsgxylk4l95tq2zyaf0r6xzcauqtcg7pl](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzp4qgk4dfevf2zvfsjkkvxdkuu9wk5hz77wj5p50vatmlh9l23ec2qqsw6xayfqaj3zqqut9txgcqr70vrsgxylk4l95tq2zyaf0r6xzcauqtcg7pl)](https://miro.medium.com/1*_G3QacaXbGZVlr04fS-bqg.png)\n\nUntil tomorrow anon :)\n\n3/24/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
