  "content": "# Day 411\n\nBeen thinking through ways to style my work nicely and what they don't tell you is that accounting for both mobile & desktop is a b****. Anyways, UI design is dope.\n\nCheck this out.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ElunaAI/status/1649346712178249729%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis website was also really well done.\n\n> [**Independent Designer & Art Director**](https://camillemormal.com/)\n\nOne day someone will make an app that helps designers have code that is both as beautiful one mobile as it is one desktop. The challenge being both the screen and the inputs a phone can recieve are very different from the desktop. No mouse or keyboard when scrolling on your iPhone, unless of course you are a psycho and found a way to do that. Much to ponder. Anyways, today is going to be short because I've been trying to figure out how to improve MassAdoption with some of these styles. Here is a helpful video if you want to do the same.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPkADl0HubMY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPkADl0HubMY&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPkADl0HubMY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n5/7/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
