Listening to my girl Paige and a podcast it was revealed to me some less talked-about facets of the King of Rock and Roll. It turns out, Elvis's life was a complex symphony, with highs that reached the top charts and lows that were, well, quite personal. Who knew that the man who gyrated his way into heartthrob status had his own set of challenges offstage? Behind every glittering jumpsuit, there's a human story, complete with its own set of struggles. The man had a wife who left him. Priscilla's departure was attributed to more than just Elvis's electrifying performances; it was the endless tours that left her singing solo at home. These revelations painted a picture of a life that, despite its glamorous veneer, was fraught with difficulties.\n\nElvis, with all his charm and charisma, serves as a poignant reminder not to skim the surface when it comes to people. It's easy to get caught up in the allure of celebrity and forget that beneath the spotlight, stars grapple with their own dilemmas. This insight nudges us to look beyond appearances and appreciate the complexities that make up a person. After all, life isn't just about hitting the right notes; it's about understanding the music behind them.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: avoid assumptions. They're like unsolicited remixes of a perfectly good track: unnecessary and often off-key. Children are the maestros of this philosophy, approaching life with a curiosity untainted by preconceived notions. Their ability to live in the moment and find joy in the simplest activities is something we stand to learn from. Just today, a game of chase with my daughter reminded me of the pure, unadulterated happiness that comes from being fully present.\n\nLearning from your mistakes is great, but moving on is even better. Focus on what actually matters. The things you truly care about, not what someone else wants you to worry about. Children seem to do such a good job with that. God gave me a beautiful moment of being in the flow state with my child today. I thank you for giving me it. It was an incredible reminder to not sweat the small stuff and do the best I can realizing it will all work out. Pretending to be a lion and chasing my daughter as she laughed in pure bliss was euphoric.\n\nThe best things in life are free. Don't get worked up unless absolutely necessary. Realize that next time you are trying to manage your anger. There's a world of reasons to let frustration take center stage, but in doing so, we risk missing out on the encore of life's more uplifting moments. Which are so plentiful if you stop and take the time to notice.\n\n3/3/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
