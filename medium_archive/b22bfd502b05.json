All of these photos were AI generated by me after I saw the photo below.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*2tYFbYvr0kV2Im3cy_H-vw.png)\n\nThe original image struck a chord with me. So much so that I ordered the book even though I know almost nothing about the Author. I can't quite explain it, but the cover just _spoke_ to me. I am reminded why people say a picture is worth a thousand words. Sometimes, a piece of art has the power to bring an unexpected sense of calm, or better yet, a sense of Zen.\n\n10/6/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
