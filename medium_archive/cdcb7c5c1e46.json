Imagine sitting there, thinking, \"Will this kid please go to sleep so I can finally have some time for myself?\" If you have a kid, I'm sure you have thought that many times. Of course, as soon as they drift off, you find yourself gazing at their peaceful, resting face, your heart melting with love and the realization that you'd do anything for them.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*RrqtPgbPQ7voqzWu)\n\nOne of the fascinating aspects of parenthood is noticing how your child mirrors your behaviors and preferences. For instance, I love being scratched and get annoyed when the person stops. My daughter is the same. Just when I think she's asleep, I stop, and she immediately wakes up with a loud cry. It's these moments that make you realize how much your child learns from you. Both genetically and from simply observing.\n\nWe live in an exciting era of AI, but can it ever truly understand and synthesize the feelings we experience as parents? Humans struggle with understanding exponential functions, so perhaps I'm wrong, but I believe that while computers might one day experience human-like emotions, we're far from that point. Achieving such a feat might require a soul, something only God can create. AI might seem to bestow god-like capabilities, but those familiar with the technology know that with every new discovery, we face even more questions.\n\nWhile raising a child is an incredible journey, fundamentally different from training an AI model, both processes involve teaching and nurturing. Language models (LLMs) require immense computational power, electricity, and silicon. In contrast, children thrive on an irreplaceable resource: their parents' love. I'm proud to share that love with my child. Even during moments when my patience wanes as I yearn to read my daily chapter or write a Medium post, I pray Sloan understands that I would do anything for her.\n\nDespite humanity's tremendous strides in technology, the process of nurturing a human being remains a remarkable and irreplaceable experience. The love and patience required in parenting are beyond what any machine can comprehend, underscoring the extraordinary bond between parent and child. Even if this life were a simulation, it's hard to believe when you look at that miniature version of yourself, filled with so much love and potential.\n\n6/10/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
