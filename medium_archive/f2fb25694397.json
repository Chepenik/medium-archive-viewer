It feels exciting getting paid to shitpost. The features that will come in the following decades from the combo of Bitcoin and Nostr are going to blow minds.\n\n> [**More Markets, Less Regulators**](https://bitcoinnews.com/more-markets-please/)\n\nHad this article get released by Bitcoin News today which I was excited about. Been too long. Got another one coming on the 26th with Bitcoin Magazine. It's about home birth and bitcoin. Somehow found a way to relate those two topicsðŸ˜‚\n\nAnyways, I am happy to report I passed my systems check at the coding bootcamp which means I'm on pace to get access to hiring partners at the end of the bootcamp. Feels good passing a test I was worried about.\n\nI'll end this by pointing out the Youtube comments section does not miss.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FXSh9-txcEHs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXSh9-txcEHs&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FXSh9-txcEHs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*qWTyNwWxhtYCC7IMcODoSw.png)\n\np.s *notes for myself* make a list about what to add in your Nostr powerpoint, make a Nostr video, and send out a podcast invite.\n\n3/24/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
