Lutnick's right to say we've developed Stockholm syndrome. This country was largely founded on resistance to a mere 2% tax on tea - a grievance that helped spark the American Revolution. Yet now, we pay more than that in sales tax alone, not to mention other taxes. It's time to revive the spirit of no taxation and rethink this burden.\n\n![[https://x.com/Breaking911/status/1899972963601993759](https://x.com/Breaking911/status/1899972963601993759)](https://miro.medium.com/1*dAdcVU-eQFkfWeAF39Bk9w.png)\n\nBeautiful. Less taxes (extortion) is a good thing. You won't convince me otherwise.\n\nI know how to spend my hard-earned money far better than a government that squanders it on absurd things. The yoke is lifting, and it's a new dawn for America!\n\n3/12/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
