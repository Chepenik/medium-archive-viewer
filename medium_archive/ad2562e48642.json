  "content": "# Day 568\n\n**A Declaration for the Mass Adoption of Sovereign Individuals**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis Constitution serves as a foundational instrument for safeguarding individual freedom and fostering local autonomy, particularly for those who aspire to individual sovereignty. Recognizing that mere fiat edicts cannot deter the forces of centralization, this document emphasizes the alignment of incentives as a bulwark against corruption and the usurpation of power. Crafted for those who envision a world guided by just rules rather than rulers, this Constitution aims to enshrine the core principles of independence, self-determination, and consensual governance.\n\n**Preamble**\n\nWe, the people of Earth, assert that all individuals inherently possess rights to self-determination, peace, freedom, justice, entrepreneurship, and prosperity. To preserve these values, we establish this Constitution of Consent. Through aligned incentives and judicious technology use, we aim to prevent monopolies on violence and ensure enduring liberty. We urge individuals to claim their sovereignty and governments to respect it, fostering a more abundant, peaceful, and just society.\n\n**Article I: Fundamental Rights and the Framework for a Sovereign Society**\n\nAcknowledging that no Constitution is perfect but serves as a vital framework for a better society, this document builds upon the seminal writings of the Magna Carta, the U.S. Constitution, and other liberty-granting documents. It aims to provide a baseline for human society to thrive in a future where technology and AI are increasingly autonomous.\n\nSection 1: Inherent Rights\n\nAll individuals are endowed with inherent and inalienable rights, including life, liberty, private property, privacy, and the pursuit of their own self-interest. These rights are sacrosanct and serve as the cornerstone of a free society, protected from encroachment by any entity - government or otherwise. Coupled with these liberties is the profound responsibility to respect others' private property and refrain from violation without explicit consent.\n\nSection 2: Government's Role\n\nThe government's primary duty is to safeguard individual rights, intervening only to prevent clear and immediate harm to others. Such intervention must prioritize peaceful resolutions over vengeance and retribution. Leaders must exhaust all nonviolent options before resorting to force, applying restraint and minimizing harm when needed.\n\nSection 3: Equality and Freedom\n\nEvery individual, irrespective of race, gender, or any other attribute, shall be treated equally by the government in all public matters. Discrimination is strictly prohibited. Individuals also have the right to associate freely in private matters, retaining their autonomy while public institutions uphold principles of fairness and non-discrimination.\n\nSection 4: Freedom of Expression\n\nThe freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and petition are essential for the free exchange of ideas, the pursuit of knowledge, and peaceful dissent. These ensure that every citizen has a voice and a platform for their beliefs.\n\nSection 5: Vision for a Sovereign Society in an Era of Disruption\n\nThis Constitution is not just a set of decrees, but a vision for empowering people who wish to live freely, guided by their own values and unencumbered by arbitrary authority. We recognize that forthcoming technological breakthroughs have the potential to disrupt the traditional frameworks of nation-states in ways unanticipated and revolutionary.\n\nWhile nation-states may not willingly relinquish their monopolies on violence, the choice may no longer be theirs to make. Advancements similar to how Uber and Lyft disrupted the taxi monopoly could likewise erode the nation-state's monopoly on violence, compelling society to grapple with new paradigms.\n\nThis Constitution is designed as a framework to navigate this unprecedented transformation. It aims to empower every individual on Earth to build a life abundant in purpose and meaning irrespective of the shifting structures of traditional governance.\n\nBy laying down these principles, we not only prepare for imminent changes but also offer a path for individual sovereignty to flourish. To realize this vision, we embrace technology as an instrument of emancipation rather than a mechanism for subjugation.\n\n**Article II: Limited, Decentralized, and Consensual Government**\n\nSection 1: Vision for Governance\n\nThe governance within this constitutional framework serves as a minimalistic instrument, specifically designed to protect individual rights and enhance societal well-being. It does not exist to dictate but to serve, adhering to the principle of essentialism in authority.\n\nSection 2: Duty and Limitation of Government\n\nThe government has one supreme duty: to protect individual rights, which include life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Any action beyond this core function is not only unjustified but also an infringement on individual sovereignty.\n\nSection 3: Rule of Law\n\nThis Constitution forbids the creation of laws that confer special privileges or exemptions upon any entity. The rule of law is the great equalizer, applied without exception or favoritism, ensuring impartial justice based on the merits of each case.\n\nSection 4: Transparency and Accountability\n\nTransparency and accountability are the bedrock of our limited governance. Every government action, decision, and financial transaction must be openly accessible to the public, empowering citizens to hold their government accountable.\n\nSection 5: Role of the Informed Citizenry\n\nAn informed populace is indispensable for upholding limited government principles. Citizens are empowered to fulfill their civic duties and participate actively in governance, unhampered by secrecy or misinformation spread from the very organization tasked with enforcing the rule of law.\n\nSection 6: Taxation and Local Legislation\n\n- Optional Taxation: Respecting the principle of individual sovereignty, the act of contributing taxes in each jurisdiction is entirely voluntary. Those who choose to contribute are granted the distinct privileges of voting and introducing legislative measures. This approach aims to positively align incentives for residents to constructively engage in their community's governance.\n\n- Limited Taxation: A 1% sales tax on the products and services offered by businesses and a 1% property tax based on the assessed value of property at the time of purchase are imposed. Individuals can own multiple homes in various jurisdictions, but if they want to propose or vote on laws in any given jurisdiction, they must pay the 1% property tax to that jurisdiction. For example, if someone owns an Airbnb rental property in a jurisdiction where they do not live and have no desire to be involved in the local government, they are free to forego paying the property tax in that jurisdiction and only pay property taxes in the jurisdiction where they reside.\n\n- Local Legislation: Those who consent to pay taxes can propose laws, requiring unanimous approval from other property taxpayers in their jurisdiction. Non-taxpayers retain all individual rights as stipulated under the Rule of Law but are not entitled to propose laws or vote.\n\n- Bitcoin Payment: The government prefers taxes to be paid in bitcoin, positioning itself robustly for financial responsibilities. Exceptions for paying in bitcoin will be made, but will be promptly converted into bitcoin. Fiat money is a tool that governments use to fund wars and print the difference between their deficits. Gold is great as commodity money, but has no hope of keeping up without being centralized in an increasingly digital world. Bitcoin is the best bet at an honest ledger that cannot be manipulated by bad actors. If things change in the future and a government wishes to receive taxes in another form of money, it is their right to do so, but they must receive unanimous consent from their taxpayers to change this law.\n\nSection 7: Formation of Jurisdictions\n\nJurisdictions can be initiated when 100% of individuals in a designated area agree to form one. Elections are held to appoint one representative in a jurisdiction to the Global High Court, reflecting the community's commitment to a just and impartial global judicial branch. Each jurisdiction is responsible for law enforcement within its boundaries, adhering to a Universal Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement.\n\nSection 8: Fluid Jurisdictions\n\nIf a group is keen on proposing a law but can't secure 100% approval, they have the right to form a new jurisdiction with like-minded individuals. This ensures that government remains small, nimble, and localized. Passing any law will not be easy when one requires 100% approval and that is the idea. If a law is so important it must pass then people will have to either present better arguments to convince their fellow taxpayers or propose new jurisidctions for those who believe so strongly in the law being proposed. This will make it nearly impossible for anyone to gain a large monopoly on violence as new jurisdictions will be created in situations when a majority is eager to get a law passed.\n\nSection 9: Governance Structure\n\nGovernments are run similarly to businesses, focusing on efficiency, accountability, and constituent service. Elections are held for CEO, CFO, and COO roles, as well as other roles as needed. If a government can run with less than three executives, that is also acceptable. Each jurisdiction can decide how many executives it needs.\n\nSection 10: Voting Mechanism\n\nElections use a blockchain-based system, ensuring transparency, security, and integrity. Individuals can register their public keys within their jurisdiction and use their unique private keys to sign for a vote. The candidate with the highest votes is elected.\n\nSection 11: Accountability, Bankruptcy, and Continuity of Governance\n\nShould a government fail to meet its obligations due to financial insolvency, the executive team - comprising the CEO, CFO, and COO, among other roles - is immediately removed from their respective positions. Promptly thereafter, new elections are convened to install a government better equipped to fulfill its responsibilities and serve the interests of its constituents.\n\nSection 12: Democratic Trigger for New Elections\n\nApart from financial insolvency, a mechanism exists for the citizenry to trigger new elections. If at any time 50% of the taxpayers within a jurisdiction vote in favor of holding new elections, the process will be initiated immediately, irrespective of the current government's financial status or efficacy.\n\nSection 13: Governance Tenure and No Term Limits\n\nThis Constitution imposes no term limits on elected officials. Should a set of executives perform extraordinarily well - keeping the government solvent and avoiding the activation of a new election threshold - these individuals may continue to serve in their roles for an indefinite period, potentially until their passing. This is in recognition of the principle that effective governance should not be arbitrarily interrupted but should be allowed to flourish for the benefit of all. The objective is to set clear standards for when a change in leadership is warranted while allowing for long-term stability under competent administration.\n\nSection 14: Global High Court\n\nThe Global High Court serves as the ultimate arbiter for value-based judgments and complex legal matters. It is comprised of a large number of members, with one member elected from each jurisdiction. Members are elected based on their reputation for neutrality and fair judgment. When cases need to be adjudicated by the Global High Court, nine members are randomly selected. Members have the right to remove themselves from a case if they believe they cannot be a neutral party. Members serve on the court for their lifetime or until they are convicted of treason in their jurisdiction, in which case they are removed and a new election is held to elect a new member. The Global High Court is limited to adjudicative functions and cannot propose laws or amendments.\n\nSection 15: Salary Consensus\n\nUpon official elections, salaries are subjected to community vote, requiring 100% consensus. Elected officials may not vote on their salaries, focusing the role on public service over personal enrichment.\n\nSection 16: Future-Proofing Governance\n\nWe recognize that future challenges and technologies may differ drastically from today's. This Constitution is designed to adapt, always prioritizing individual sovereignty over unchecked governmental power.\n\n**Article III: Assurance of Market Integrity and Prohibition of Cronyism**\n\nWithin this constitutional framework, we affirm the sanctity of free markets as fundamental to economic freedom and societal well-being. This article delineates the government's role as a neutral arbiter in market dynamics, ensuring that individual rights to property, trade, entrepreneurship, and innovation are protected while preventing crony capitalism and other forms of market manipulation.\n\nSection 1: Affirmation of Free Markets Governed by Rule of Law\n\nFree markets are not anarchic spaces; they operate under a comprehensive set of rules that are clear, fair, and consistently applied. The government serves as an impartial referee in this context, enforcing these rules to ensure that competition is fair and that market misconduct is penalized.\n\nSection 2: Protection of Individual Property Rights\n\nEvery individual possesses the inalienable right to own, manage, and administer their property, whether it be real estate, businesses, or personal assets. This right serves as the backbone of a free society, enabling individuals to act according to their own values and interests.\n\nSection 3: Duties to Promote Competitive Markets\n\nThe government has a solemn duty to foster an environment that encourages market competition. Any forms of monopolistic practices, collusion, and other anti-competitive behaviors are strictly prohibited. Government intervention in the market is to be unbiased and only to maintain fair market dynamics.\n\nSection 4: Decentralized Regulatory Oversight\n\nCentralized regulatory bodies are antithetical to this Constitution. Instead, each jurisdiction may establish local regulatory committees through unanimous consent from its taxpayers. These committees are tasked with overseeing market practices within their respective sectors.\n\nSection 5: Transparency in Governance and Business\n\nAll interactions between business entities and government officials are to be fully transparent, recorded in a blockchain-based public ledger. This ensures that any taxpayer within the relevant jurisdiction can audit these interactions.\n\nSection 6: Whistleblower Safeguards\n\nIndividuals who courageously expose cronyism or illegal activities are protected from any form of retaliation. All whistleblower cases are subject to review by the Global High Court, ensuring due process and impartial justice.\n\nSection 7: Consumer Rights and Environmental Stewardship\n\nConsumer protections are enacted through local laws, requiring unanimous consent from property taxpayers. Similarly, each jurisdiction is responsible for establishing environmental guidelines, which also require unanimous consent for enactment.\n\nSection 8: Review and Appeals Mechanism\n\nAny party aggrieved by regulatory decisions has the right to appeal. Initially, appeals are directed to local jurisdictional committees, and if needed, can be escalated to the Global High Court.\n\nSection 9: Ethical Conduct and Conflict of Interest\n\nGovernment officials are expressly prohibited from having any financial interests in matters they regulate. Bi-annual, blockchain-verified audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of anti-cronyism measures, with findings made publicly accessible.\n\nSection 10: Penalties for Violations\n\nCronyism is treated as a severe offense against societal well-being. Penalties range from a minimum of ten years in prison, immediate removal from public office, to asset seizures. Extreme measures like life imprisonment or the death penalty are invoked only in cases adjudicated by the Global High Court as high treason against the Constitution.\n\nSection 11: Global Trade and Technological Governance\n\nJurisdictions have the freedom to engage in international trade and relations but must adhere to the principles of this Constitution. Blockchain technology will be leveraged for enhanced transparency in public contracts and international agreements.\n\nSection 12: Market Access and Tax Obligations\n\nIndividuals not contributing taxes are free to participate in markets but relinquish the right to influence market regulations and consumer protections. Businesses are subject to a 1% sales tax, utilized to fund market regulatory activities.\n\nSection 13: Intellectual Property and Contractual Obligations\n\nThe integrity of intellectual property and contracts is sacrosanct. The government is committed to enforcing these rights, thereby fostering an environment conducive for innovation and fair trade.\n\nSection 14: Ethical and Judicial Integrity\n\nActs of cronyism are tantamount to betraying the collective trust of sovereign individuals. Public officials are held to the highest standards of ethical conduct, and any deviation is considered a breach of this social contract.\n\n**Article IV: The Intersection of Technology and Personal Privacy**\n\nSection 1: Inalienable Right to Technological Freedom\n\nThe freedom to use technology for lawful and benevolent purposes is an inalienable right. This includes the unequivocal right to privacy with respect to personal data, electronic communications, and digital devices. Sovereign individuals are granted the liberty to engage with technology, enjoying the freedom to access, modify, and innovate without undue limitations.\n\nSection 2: The Positive Impact of Technology\n\nTechnology serves as a catalyst for societal improvement and the betterment of human life. All entities - individuals, businesses, and organizations - are encouraged to contribute to this collective advancement. We commit to facilitating responsible and optimal technological utilization as a means to achieve universal prosperity.\n\nSection 3: The Primacy of Personal Privacy\n\nPersonal privacy is a cornerstone of our constitutional framework. Sovereign individuals have the innate right to control their personal data, secure their communications, and protect their digital devices. Surveillance by any governmental or non-governmental entity mandates a specific, legally-sanctioned warrant, backed by probable cause and adhering to strict legal standards.\n\nSection 4: Treasonous Acts and Unlawful Surveillance\n\nNon-compliance with privacy norms constitutes not just an illegal act but an act of treason, equatable to cronyism. Violations will incur severe penalties, including immediate expulsion from public office and eligibility for criminal prosecution.\n\nSection 5: Discouraging Invasive Surveillance Technologies\n\nWhile acknowledging that many technologies have dual uses, our jurisdiction strictly prohibits technologies primarily designed for invasive surveillance. The aim is to discourage bad actors by eliminating tools that inherently compromise due process and enable unwarranted data collection.\n\nSection 6: Ethical Use of General-Purpose Technologies\n\nGeneral-purpose technologies like smartphones and computers are exempt from this prohibition, provided their usage adheres to ethical guidelines and established privacy norms. The ethical use of technology is essential for balancing innovation with the right to privacy.\n\nSection 7: Exceptional Circumstances for Surveillance\n\nSurveillance is generally impermissible, but allowances for exceptions are made under extraordinary conditions. These exceptions are subject to rigorous due process and legal scrutiny to ensure compliance with this constitutional mandate.\n\nSection 8: Upholding Privacy and Civil Liberties\n\nThis Article serves as a declaration of our unyielding commitment to the intertwined principles of technological liberty and personal privacy. It erects barriers against the abuse of technology at the expense of individual freedoms, ensuring that technological innovation can be pursued without sacrificing fundamental human rights.\n\nThrough the ratification of these principles, we provide a sturdy framework that both encourages technological innovation and fiercely guards the inviolable sanctity of individual privacy.\n\n**Article V: Reinforcing Decentralized Governance through Local Autonomy**\n\nSection 1: Guiding Philosophy of Local Autonomy\nIn pursuit of optimal governance, we endorse a decentralized model, placing decision-making authority as close to the citizenry as pragmatically possible. Local communities are empowered to govern themselves, provided they uphold the foundational rights delineated in Article I.\n\nSection 2: Taxation and Participatory Governance\nProperty-owning individuals contributing a 1% annual tax on their assets are vested with the right to propose changes to governance protocols. The adoption of these proposals necessitates unanimous consent from all community residents, a stipulation designed to foster smaller, competitive jurisdictions and consensual governance.\n\nSection 3: Principles of Experimentation and Innovation\nWe uphold local autonomy as a cornerstone of governance, emphasizing the value of experimentation and innovation. This focus supersedes any form of centralized planning or bureaucratic control, recognizing that the most effective communities arise from the collective intelligence of their residents.\n\nSection 4: Customized Governance\nAcknowledging the unique characteristics of each community, we advocate for the decentralization of powers, enabling local jurisdictions to tailor governance to their specific needs and values.\n\nSection 5: Formation and Transition of Jurisdictions\nIf unanimous consent for a proposed law is not achieved but substantial support exists, individuals maintain the right to form new jurisdictions or transition to others more aligned with their views. This ensures a dynamic and responsive governance landscape.\n\nSection 6: Role of the Global High Court in Localized Governance\nFor issues surpassing local jurisdiction, the Global High Court, as outlined in Article II, serves as the final authority. It harmonizes local autonomy with global governance imperatives, providing adjudication for matters with broader implications or inter-jurisdictional conflicts.\n\nSection 7: Transparency and Public Participation\nThe Global High Court is committed to principles of transparency, public participation, and the safeguarding of individual rights in all its proceedings.\n\nSection 8: Encouragement for Governance Innovation\nCommunities are actively encouraged to experiment with governance structures, fostering a dynamic environment where effective models can be shared, adapted, and refined.\n\nBy embodying these principles, we aim to establish a governance framework that is agile, locally tailored, and unwavering in its protection of individual rights and liberties. This approach seeks to invigorate the democratic process, catalyze local creativity, and preserve the diverse identities of all sovereign individuals.\n\n**Article VI: The Living Constitution - An Instrument of Evolutionary Governance**\n\nSection 1: Fluidity and Adaptability\n\nBuilt on a foundation of adaptability, this Constitution is not a static document but a living instrument, fine-tuned to resonate with society's ever-changing needs and circumstances.\n\nSection 2: Mechanism for Amendments\n\nTo ensure this living document reflects the will of its people, we have established a stringent amendment process rooted in unanimous consensus within any given jurisdiction. This mechanism maintains that substantive changes are enacted only with the comprehensive agreement of all affected constituents, fortifying the sanctity of individual sovereignty.\n\nSection 3: Unanimous Civic Engagement and Technological Empowerment\n\nIn our governance model, the collective is an extension of individual will, making civic participation not merely desirable but essential. We employ cutting-edge technology to facilitate this level of unanimity, effectively counteracting the accumulation of power in any single entity or group.\n\nSection 4: The March Toward Marginal Governance\n\nInspired by the economic principle that innovation continually drives the cost of goods towards their marginal cost of production, we envision a parallel in governance. As society advances and abundance becomes the norm, the need for governmental oversight proportionately diminishes. In this future, the government's role transitions from an enforcer to a mere facilitator, existing primarily to protect individual rights and promote collective well-being.\n\nSection 5: Evolutionary Governance\n\nBy codifying these principles, we aim to enact a form of governance that is not static but evolutionary, capable of adapting to the kaleidoscopic complexities that will confront future generations. It will do so while remaining steadfastly anchored in the core tenets that make up the fabric of our society of sovereign individuals.\n\nIn crafting this Article, we create a governance model as agile as it is deeply rooted in the principles that define our collective of sovereign individuals, ensuring its capacity to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing landscape.\n\n**Article VII: Primacy of Individual Consent in Governance**\n\nSection 1: The Core of Legitimate Governance\n\nThe fulcrum of legitimate governance rests on the explicit, revocable consent of each individual citizen. This Constitution serves as a social contract for sovereign individuals, elevating the individual - not the collective - as the ultimate locus of authority. Those who adopt this Constitution must unequivocally endorse this cornerstone principle to qualify as sovereign entities.\n\nSection 2: Voluntary Adoption and Revocable Consent\n\nThe principles articulated herein are designed for voluntary adoption. Every sovereign individual provides their ongoing, revocable consent to be governed by this framework. In matters of constitutional amendments, absence of dissent will be construed as consent, placing the responsibility on residents to express opposition to any proposed changes.\n\nSection 3: Non-Majoritarian Principle\n\nThe tyranny of the majority shall not be a means to encroach upon the freedoms or rights of any minority, except through their explicit consent. Organizational rights - be they governmental, corporate, or otherwise - shall never override individual rights. Consent stands as the indispensable fulcrum upon which any collective decision pivots.\n\nSection 4: Technological Empowerment for Participation\n\nHarnessing state-of-the-art technology, we commit to expanding platforms that allow for individual input in governance. This digital infrastructure will offer secure, accessible avenues for sovereign individuals to propose, scrutinize, and vote on pertinent issues.\n\nSection 5: Automatic Triggers for Consent Preservation\n\nTo safeguard the inviolability of individual consent, automated reform triggers are instituted. Actions contrary to liberty - such as coercion in electoral processes, lack of transparency, or any breach of prior Articles - will activate these triggers. Their activation will result in a provisional devolution of authority, restoring power back to the individual. Governance can only be reconstituted upon re-affirmation of explicit consent and formation of a new jurisdiction through unanimous accord.\n\nSection 6: Affirmation of Participatory and Consensual Governance\n\nThrough the stipulations of this Article, we assert our unwavering dedication to a governance framework that is both participatory and rooted in the sanctity of individual consent. This approach ensures that the liberties and voices of all sovereign entities are conscientiously honored and safeguarded.\n\n**In Closing: The Genesis of Our Sovereign Future**\n\nIn crystallizing the principles that guide this Constitution, we initiate a societal metamorphosis - one that transcends traditional barriers and elevates the individual as the nucleus of governance. This document doesn't merely reiterate the virtues of freedom and autonomy; it operationalizes them in a framework that is both agile and robust. This is not a duplication of past efforts but an evolutionary leap, aiming to reconcile the timeless principles of human dignity with the dynamic possibilities of our age.\n\nAs we embark on this transformative journey, let this Constitution be understood as more than a legal instrument. It is a social contract, reimagined. Our focus on the 'consent of the governed' is not a mere philosophical stance; it is the practical bedrock that ensures this framework can adapt, evolve, and sustain itself through the trials and opportunities of the coming epochs. The individual, empowered by technology and invigorated by liberty, is not just a citizen but a co-creator of this emerging societal tapestry.\n\nThis Constitution is not a static parchment but a dynamic interface, capable of capturing the collective wisdom and individual sovereignty of its adopters. It invites active participation, valuing not just the rights but also the responsibilities of each sovereign individual. It acknowledges that our interdependence can coexist with our independence, and that freedom can flourish alongside a foundational set of shared values.\n\nIn this document, we have explored the mechanisms that protect individual rights, limit government intrusion, and define the boundaries of personal freedom. But this is not an end; it's a beginning. Each Article, each clause serves as a launching pad for continual dialogue, revision, and refinement. This Constitution is not an artifact but a living organism, as adaptable and resilient as the individuals it serves.\n\nOur approach to governance is innovative but rooted in eternal human values. We have not shied away from leveraging technological advancements, not as overlords but as enablers of a more transparent, participatory, and consensual governance model. We affirm that the efficacy of this Constitution will not be measured by its immutability but by its capacity to evolve without compromising its core principles.\n\nIn adopting this Constitution, we are not merely drafting a legal framework; we are authoring the future. It is a future that belongs not to states or institutions but to each of us - as individuals endowed with inherent rights and inviolable dignities. This is our manifesto for the new sovereign world, a declaration not just of independence but of interdependence, in a society where freedom is both the means and the end.\n\nAs we unfurl this Constitution, we do so with a vision that reaches beyond the immediate horizon. We are crafting not just a document but a legacy - a testament to human ingenuity and a blueprint for a society that can be as free as it is united, as innovative as it is stable, and as compassionate as it is just.\n\nThus, we affirm this Constitution as our collective proclamation to the world, signaling the dawn of a new era - an era of sovereign liberty, decentralized governance, and endless possibilities. May it serve as our guide, our contract, and our shared vision for a world reborn in the image of the sovereign individual.\n\n10/11/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
