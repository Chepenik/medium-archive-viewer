  "content": "# Day 684\n\n**The Vanguard Bitcoin ETF: Not Happening**\n\nVanguard is under fire for its refusal to offer clients the option to invest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that not only alienates forward-thinking investors but also threatens the firm's longevity in a rapidly changing financial ecosystem. This resistance to embracing a pivotal innovation in investment contradicts the core principles of economic efficiency and market evolution. By turning a cold shoulder to the groundbreaking potential of Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard isn't just snubbing the zeitgeist of economic evolution; it's practically penning its own death. As the financial landscape undergoes a seismic shift away from the once-sacred 60/40 portfolio doctrine, Vanguard's stance could be its most memorable punchline - choosing to sit out the dance at a time when the beat of innovation has never been more irresistible.\n\n**Economic Efficiency**\n\nEconomics 101 tells us that when prices drop to the cost of making something, it's not the end times but a high-five from the market for getting more bang for our buck. Imagine making chocolate cheaper and faster. It's like the universe's way of saying, \"Here, have some extra happiness.\" In a world where efficiency is king, lower costs don't just disappear; they come back to us, the chocolate-loving public, in the form of cheaper prices. It's the economic circle of life: improved productivity means more goodies for less money, proving once again that in the grand scheme of things, being efficient makes everyone's life a little sweeter and a lot more chocolate-filled.\n\n**Why Traditional Finance Feels Like a Party Pooper**\n\nTraditional finance has a penchant for bureaucratic red tape, exorbitant fees, and central bank overseers. These bureaucrats are party poopers who insist on turning down the music just as the rhythm starts to pick up. It's a world obsessed with maintaining control, putting barriers around the free exchange of ideas and capital that drive economic festivities. Rather than enabling a vibrant marketplace where innovation and wealth generation can flourish, traditional finance orchestrates a restrained gathering, where the playlist is monopolized by the few (those with the power to print money). This approach not only dampens the spirit of economic progress but also restricts the flow of groundbreaking ideas to the market, allowing inefficiencies (bad songs) to disrupt the overall harmony.\n\n**Bitcoin's Role in Catalyzing Economic Innovation**\n\nBitcoin challenges the status quo, refusing to comply with the arbitrary constraints imposed by traditional gatekeepers. In Bitcoin's domain, the concept of elite privileges and opaque dealings is replaced with an egalitarian framework, where the rules are transparent, immutable, and apply equally to all participants. Bitcoin introduces a revolutionary protocol that enables anyone within its network to transfer value across the vast, digital expanse of the internet, akin to a global, inclusive dance floor where everyone has the opportunity to participate. This digital currency is not just a form of '[rogue money](https://bitcoinnews.com/adoption/x-showdown-samantha-laduc/)'; it's a beacon of financial democracy, offering a playground where fairness reigns supreme, and where the economic party is open to all, free from the stifling oversight of central authority.\n\n**Vanguard's Missed Opportunity**\n\nBy not allowing investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard not only limits its clients' potential to engage with this innovative financial tool but also ignores the broader economic implications. Bitcoin's ability to ensure a solid, immutable, and decentralized economic base layer offers a pathway to improved efficiency and productivity, benefits that Vanguard's stance fails to capture. This will only hurt Vanguard in the long run.\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\n\nBy rejecting spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard not only overlooks a chance for financial innovation but also the potential for a more efficient and inclusive economic system. Bitcoin is essential for societal progress. It is the most honest ledger of money humanity has ever created.\n\nIn the pursuit of financial freedom, the best interest lies not in avoiding the new and the untested, but in embracing the possibility of what could be. The market, in its infinite wisdom, allows for a myriad of choices. To attempt to stifle that, to control it, is to misunderstand the very nature of economic progress. Bitcoin, in all its volatile glory, stands as a beacon for those who believe in the power of unbridled, market-driven growth. Let the money flow where it will, and watch as the old barriers crumble under the weight of new possibilities.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*oriRcGv-0Pr64liz)\n\n2/4/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
