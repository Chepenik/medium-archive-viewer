  "content": "# Day 1088\n\nToday I spent the evening cooking and hanging with my Grandparents who don't live in the same town as me. Man do I love getting to see them. It's so special getting to spend time with my family. It goes by so fast and it feels surreal to watch my Daughter traverse the same hill in my Grandparents front yard that I used to when I was about that age.\n\nRight after writing that I decided to send my Daughter an email. She is two so I maintain the account for her until she is old enough to use it herself and when I went to check on it and make sure all is well I saw this.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*HZlCanFzQH2FNklw6Vxddw.png)\n\nNow you might be thinking ok and? Well I will tell you what. This dude on X had one of the wildest calls I've ever seen during my time in Bitcoin.\n\n![[https://x.com/JoshMandell6/status/1853996247549366548](https://x.com/JoshMandell6/status/1853996247549366548)](https://miro.medium.com/1*M_Q56m4Af9pKLT9-Qemaxg.png)\n\nThis was where Bitcoin ended up today at the close (UTC time):\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*JFWsclaKz0SCd_1IxR7TaA.png)\n\nBitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin.\n\nIt's funny how the universe is always making these little anomlies. I am so bullish on life. It's a bright orange future anon. Enjoy it!\n\n3/14/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
