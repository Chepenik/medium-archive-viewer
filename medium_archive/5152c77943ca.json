Usually, I'm the type to juggle multiple books, hopping between chapters like a literary nomad. But this time, I've decided to settle down and journey through this one cover to cover. It's not just the captivating art and traditional Chinese binding that's got me hooked (although, who doesn't love a good picture book?), but the deep, challenging insights into a culture so different from my own. Here is what Amazon has to say about the book:\n\n> **Beautifully produced in traditional Chinese binding and with a timeless design, _Bushido Illustrated: The Soul of Japan_ includes the classic Inazo Nitobe text with a new introduction and colorful illustrations throughout.**\n\n> \"Chivalry is a flower no less indigenous to the soil of Japan than cherry blossom\" are the opening words to Inazo Nitobe's _Bushido: The Soul of Japan_. It was 1900 and Inazo, a Japanese academic living in the USA, had been prompted to write the book after an American professor had wondered how the Japanese imparted moral education to their children if schools didn't offer any religious instruction. The answer, Inazo realized, was through Bushido. Bushido is the chivalric code of moral principles that the Samurai followed: rectitude, courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, and loyalty. Influenced by Confucianism, Shinto, and Zen Buddhism, it tempers the violence of a warrior with wisdom and serenity. Alongside Sun Tzu's _The Art of War_ and Machiavelli's _The Prince_, Inazo's book has become influential among military and corporate leaders looking for ways to manage their people and overcome their opponents.\n\nMany of these concepts feel foreign me as a modern day American man in his late 20s. Take the idea of not showing emotions - I'm sorry, but if I stub my toe, the whole neighborhood's going to hear about it. There was a line that made me chuckle today, comparing public displays of affection (or the lack thereof) between cultures. It was something along the lines of Japanese men beat their wives in public, but kiss them in private. American men kiss their wives in public, but beat them in private. Now obviously beating your wife is wrong, always. But it's fascinating to see how cultural norms shape behavior.\n\nIn Japan, children are taught from a young age to maintain composure, to be the calm in the storm. Meanwhile, in the West, we're often encouraged to wear our hearts on our sleeves, sometimes to the point where oversharing becomes an Olympic sport.\n\nLearning about these cultural contrasts isn't just intriguing; it's deeply enriching. It makes me see the nuances of my own culture with a newfound sense of appreciation while gaining respect for the traditions that shape others. Perhaps there's a sweet spot - a way to honor the discipline of emotional restraint without letting feelings fester like a pressure cooker.\n\nFor me, finding that balance between stoicism and healthy emotional expression is a work in progress. Suppressing emotions is like never allowing a small, necessary brushfire to clear the undergrowth. Eventually, it builds up until you're faced with a full-blown wildfire - an emotional explosion waiting to happen. Maybe it's time to learn when to let a little fire burn before it all goes up in flames.\n\nWe live in a world that relentlessly pushes us to react, express, and consume without pause. The way of Bushido, in contrast, offers a powerful antidote: the art of intentional living. It teaches us that true strength comes from mastering oneself, from acting with unwavering integrity even when no one is watching, and from treating honor not as a lofty abstraction but as a daily practice. We may not wield swords in the traditional sense, but in the daily battles of modern life, even a sliver of the Samurai's discipline and grace could guide us toward a life of deeper wisdom and purpose. Sure, I might never fully embrace the idea that suicide can be a noble exit, but the beauty of learning from other cultures is realizing that even if we don't agree with everything, there's still a world of wisdom waiting to enrich our understanding.\n\n11/6/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
