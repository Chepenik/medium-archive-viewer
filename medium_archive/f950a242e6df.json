  "content": "# Day 572\n\nAfter a busy week working on my constitution, it's great to be back to my regular writing. I'm thinking of sharing a read of my new constitution in a YouTube video soon. The main goal I had in mind was to shift the focus from the nation-state to the individual as the central figure of power and rights, ie the one who is sovereign. It was an interesting but challenging task. Most constitutions outline what a government can't do to ensure people's rights. So, figuring out how to further empower individuals while still having clear rules was a unique challenge. I had to consider enforcement, whether people can opt-out, and how to ensure it all works smoothly. My approach? Lean on the free market, set clear rules, and use tech to help. I'm hopeful that this approach can lead to a world where everyone gets a fair shot.\n\nIt's astonishing to think about seminal texts like the U.S. Constitution and the Magna Carta. These were once mere ideas on paper, yet they transformed societies, anchoring principles of justice and liberty that still resonate today. While it might seem audacious to hope that the words I've digitally inscribed could parallel the significance of such foundational documents, I remain optimistic. I dream that, in time, the principles I've outlined might ripple through society, fostering a world that upholds the sanctity of individual rights and freedoms, just as those landmark texts did.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*x2uq3qsb_vTikYdOvIOn-Q.png)\n\nMy attention has largely been on drafting a global constitution, which has kept me from commenting extensively on the Israel/Palestine conflict. Given its complexities, distinguishing between truth and falsehood is challenging. However, one thing remains lucid: the imperative need to prevent war. The tragic loss of civilian lives should be universally unacceptable. The cycle where vengeance spurs more vengeance is concerning, and I anticipate that the repercussions of current actions will manifest as \"unintended consequences\" in future discussions.\n\nThe trend of showcasing allegiance on social media platforms seems misguided. It reminds me of individuals parading Ukraine flags on their profiles, despite possibly having minimal knowledge of its history or geography. Such symbolic actions often amount to virtue signaling without any real impact. The profound implications of war, compounded by the amplified influence of propaganda on platforms like social media, are alarming. It's crucial to exercise discernment when letting online narratives shape our perspectives.\n\nI'm not proud to admit that before this conflict, I hadn't fully understood the distinction between Zionism and Judaism. The brevity of social media often strips discussions of their nuances. I find solace in long-form writing, which allows for a deeper dive into issues, enabling a better understanding of differing viewpoints. Through my research, I came to understand Zionism as a political movement advocating for a Jewish homeland in historical Palestine, and Judaism as a religion deeply entrenched in the teachings of the Torah and the vast traditions of the Jewish community.\n\nI'm incredibly fortunate to reside in a relatively safe environment, especially when comparing global circumstances. This post serves as an outlet for my frustrations regarding ongoing conflicts, and while its impact might be as symbolic as a Ukraine flag in a bio, my genuine desire is for a world of peace. Today, I offered a prayer for enduring tranquility and the protection of the innocent. While my perspectives are influenced by personal beliefs, I ponder the possibility that without massive centralized nation-states - entities that possess the ability to manufacture money on a whim and exert unparalleled force - global tensions might be lessened.\n\nGovernments seem to be the biggest criminal organizations in the world. If we don't like their services, it is incredibly difficult to opt out unless one is exceptionally wealthy. For those in the U.S.A. wanting to exit, they're slapped with an exit tax. Utter madness.\n\nHowever, I remain hopeful. The trajectory of technology, with its promise to bolster individual agency and make large-scale conflicts financially untenable, is a fascinating evolution to witness. Despite the uncertainties of the future, humanity managed to exercise restraint after unveiling nuclear weapons. Similarly, I believe we won't let AI lead us to our downfall. I have faith that a God is guiding us.\n\n10/15/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik\n\n![Generated on Dalle with the following prompt \"Drawing of an Israeli man and a Palestinian man standing on opposite sides of a bridge.
