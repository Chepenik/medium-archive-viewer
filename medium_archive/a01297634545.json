Enjoyed today by drinking beer, eating hot dogs & hamburgers, hanging with friends, and soaking up sun on the beach. Exhausted? Absolutely. Grateful for the day off? You bet your star-spangled shorts I am!\n\nDespite the political circus that America finds itself dealing with, the spirit of this great nation will continue to shine brighter than the fireworks being blasted off today. We might have a bunch of Muppets in power, but the ethos of this country will forever live on strong.\n\nHappy 4th of July.\n\nHere's to another ~250 years of freedom, or at least until we can find a new planet to colonize. I love you America.\n\nLFGðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸\n\n7/4/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
