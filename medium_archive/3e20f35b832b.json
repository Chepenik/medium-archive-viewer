  "content": "# Day 447\n\nWhat a great day I had. Took my daughter to her first movie. (Shout out the baby matinee). Also played hoops with friends. Basketball is so much fun.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1668417807178924038%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis tweet is both funny and insightful. Today I heard Micheal Saylor say that economics is just people gaslighting each other. It's a pretty fair point. I want something? No I don't want it. Well unless you want it... oh you would pay that much I don't want it anymore and so on goes the process of a market.\n\nLife is weird. So find the little ember in it that brings you meaning. Might be one thing, might be a lot of things. Having a passion is important. Mine is Bitcoin if you have not noticed yet LOL.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FJ38-PQ6X8HI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ38-PQ6X8HI&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FJ38-PQ6X8HI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/americanhodl8/status/1668407479749980160%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nWhat a meme template. Even if Bitcoin is a cult at least the side effects are lower time preference, a tendency to start a family, and more red meat.\n\n6/12/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
