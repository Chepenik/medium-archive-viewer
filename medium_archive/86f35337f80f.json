Coached a flag football game today, and we lost by a touchdown in the final seconds. Even as a coach, I feel just as fired up about winning as I did when I played. That competitive fire never fades and losing is such a shi* feeling.\n\nCoaching is this wild mix of exhilarating and maddening. I'm itching to jump in, snag a flag, or break a tackle myself but there's something unreal about guiding young athletes instead. Calling plays, sharpening their skills, watching them grow? That's the payoff. I miss my playing days like crazy, but seeing them crush it has been great. Glad I decided to coach this year.\n\nWe had the game in our hands, but penalties from talking smack and having shirts untucked cost us. That's on me. If they're not disciplined and focused, I haven't done my job well enough. Coaching is about more than just calling plays. I need to do better so they can be better. Tough loss, but an important lesson for all of us.\n\n![Team Bitcoin Forever Because We Stay Winning No Matter What \"Bitcoin has no top because fiat has no bottom\"](https://miro.medium.com/1*V4rfRfAjTPVuN53G8XFu4w.png)\n\n2/18/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
