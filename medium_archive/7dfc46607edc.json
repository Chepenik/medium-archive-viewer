It reflects the belief that actions speak louder than words, and true change is brought about through tangible technological contributions. It emphasizes the power of individual agency and the ability to effect meaningful transformations by actively engaging with code and cryptography.\n\nEdward Snowden, a former intelligence contractor, courageously exposed the extent of mass surveillance conducted by government agencies, shedding light on the erosion of privacy in the digital age. His actions demonstrated the necessity of protecting individual freedoms and sparked a global conversation about the balance between security and privacy. Despite his significant contribution to public awareness, Snowden continues to face exile and legal persecution, rather than being acknowledged as a whistleblower who acted in the public interest.\n\nSimilarly, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, played a crucial role in promoting transparency and accountability by publishing classified information. While his actions have been controversial, they have undeniably exposed government misconduct and shed light on the need for greater transparency in public affairs. Assange's ongoing legal battles and prolonged confinement reflect a disregard for the important role he has played in advocating for press freedom and government accountability.\n\nRoss Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road, an online marketplace that facilitated transactions using cryptocurrency, represents a more complex case. Although Ulbricht's platform facilitated illegal activities, it also highlighted the potential of decentralized systems and cryptocurrencies to challenge traditional power structures. Ulbricht's case raises important questions about the boundaries of individual freedom, the implications of emerging technologies, and the need for a nuanced approach when considering the punishment for his actions.\n\nIt is regrettable that these individuals, who have made significant contributions to the cypherpunk movement and the broader discourse on privacy and digital liberties, have faced severe consequences for their actions. Instead of vilifying and punishing them, society should engage in a more nuanced dialogue about the implications of their work, the balance between security and privacy, and the role of technology in shaping our future.\n\nIn the cypherpunk philosophy, writing code is not merely an intellectual exercise or a technical pursuit; it is an act of rebellion, an expression of resistance against centralized authority and oppressive systems. It symbolizes the refusal to accept the status quo and the determination to create alternative pathways that prioritize privacy, security, and individual freedoms.\n\nBy writing code, cypherpunks develop tools and software that challenge existing power structures, enabling encryption, anonymity, and decentralized systems. They envision a world where individuals have control over their personal data, communication channels are secure from surveillance, and financial transactions are conducted with transparency and autonomy.\n\nThe act of writing code serves as a catalyst for change, a means of building a future that aligns with cypherpunk values of privacy, decentralization, and self-sovereignty. It fosters a spirit of collaboration, as cypherpunks share their knowledge, ideas, and innovations with like-minded individuals to collectively advance the cause of digital emancipation.\n\nMoreover, \"Cypherpunks write code\" embodies the notion that theory alone is insufficient without practical implementation. It recognizes the importance of translating abstract concepts and theoretical frameworks into concrete applications that can be utilized by the wider community. Through their code, cypherpunks demonstrate the feasibility and real-world impact of their ideas, inspiring others to join the movement and contribute to the ongoing evolution of digital freedoms.\n\nCypherpunks write code is a call to action. It is affirmation of the transformative power of technology, and a rallying cry for individuals to actively participate in shaping a future where privacy, security, and individual liberties are fundamental principles.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with cherishing one's privacy. In fact, those who argue otherwise should be willing to relinquish their own privacy for an extended period of time. Only if they can genuinely report back feeling happier, safer, and better off might their perspective be worth considering.\n\nâœŠðŸ’œ\n\n5/21/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
