  "content": "# Day 926\n\nToday, I became a homeowner - a milestone that's both exhilarating and surreal. It's a fantastic step for my family, but let's not forget the less glamorous co-star: the mortgage. Imagine signing up for a marathon you didn't train for, then realizing it lasts 30 years. Talk about a long-term commitment!\n\n![This is an AI house not my real house](https://miro.medium.com/1*aCiHj_iRsP_aHxAWaMzQXQ.png)\n\nDespite the financial tightrope walk ahead, I'm genuinely thrilled to start building equity in a place where my family can put down roots and grow. It feels strange to say it out loud: me, a homeowner? I always thought I'd be funneling my spare cash into Bitcoin, dreaming of digital riches. But as it turns out, you can't curl up with a warm laptop at night or host Thanksgiving dinner in the blockchain.\n\nSo here we are, keys in hand, ready to paint the town... or at least my bedroom.\n\n10/3/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
