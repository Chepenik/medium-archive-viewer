Here are some benefits of incorporating these activities into your routine:\n\n1. Mood Boost: Walking and running release endorphins, also known as \"feel-good\" hormones, which can enhance your mood and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety.\n\n2. Increased Energy: Regular exercise, including walking and running, can boost your energy levels and combat fatigue, leaving you feeling more invigorated throughout the day.\n\n3. Mental Clarity: Physical activity stimulates blood flow to the brain, improving cognitive function, focus, and overall mental clarity. It can help you think more clearly and creatively.\n\n4. Stress Relief: Walking and running serve as excellent stress-relieving activities. They provide a healthy outlet to release tension and clear your mind, promoting relaxation and a sense of calm.\n\n5. Improved Sleep: Regular exercise can enhance the quality of your sleep. Walking or running during the day helps regulate your sleep patterns, leading to more restful nights and increased overall happiness.\n\nIt's important to choose an exercise routine that suits your fitness level. Something is better than nothing. If all you can do is walk, well then walk until you are able to run. Just do something.\n\n6/15/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
