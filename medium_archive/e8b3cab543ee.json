  "content": "# Day 456\n\nToday, out of the blue, a friend unexpectedly invited me to play paintball. Luckily I was free and eagerly accepted the offer. I've played paintball before but it had been awhile so I was ready to dive into the thrilling world of paintball once again. As the game unfolded, it reignited the sheer exhilaration and excitement that shooting guns (in both video games & real life) brings about. My adrenaline was pumping hard after each match.\n\nThe rapid pace of the paint pellets, soaring through the air at an astounding speed of 200 miles per hour, added an extra level of intensity to the game. The joy and camaraderie that come with shooting and being shot in paintball create a unique sense of excitement that is truly unparalleled.\n\nReflecting on my paintball experience, I couldn't help but feel immense gratitude that I don't have to face the harsh realities of actual warfare with real guns. Being a soldier is undeniably one of the most challenging jobs in the world. It deeply saddens me that conflicts and wars still persist today, despite the abundance of technology available to address poverty and create a more prosperous world for all. I believe that fiat currency plays a significant role in perpetuating war, and this is where Bitcoin comes into play.\n\nIn many ways, I find myself repeating the same message over and over again about how Bitcoin can address these issues. However, I recognize that true change begins with self-improvement. By focusing on improving ourselves as individuals, we can influence positive transformations in the world around us. Although Bitcoin has played a tremendous role in my personal growth, I believe that it is our own actions and mindset that ultimately shape our impact on the world.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*dstXJ3py2qU7n_0kSXAe7Q.png)\n\nShout out Adobe's new AI art generator tools. Amazing how many dope products are coming to market so quickly. I've been using AI to help with my writing, coding, even editing. Most of my youtube shorts are generated with Dumme now.\n\n> [**Dumme | AI Powered Shorts**](https://dumme.com/)\n\nNot sponsored or endorsed by the Dumme team I just think they have made a truly spectacular product. It is so clear to me that Bitcoin and AI working together are the tools humanity needs to create more peace, prosperity, and abundance for every human being on this planet. Grateful I get to live through this time. Also let this serve as a reminder to myself be more present. Take the time to observe your thoughts and feelings more. Don't just check out to your phone 24/7/365 because you can now. Appreciate what you have and when you do leverage the interwebs use new tools to make the experience even better.\n\n6/21/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
