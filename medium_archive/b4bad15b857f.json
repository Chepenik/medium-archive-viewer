  "content": "# Day 278\n\nMerry Christmas everyone! Today is a special day because people get an opportunity to give and spend time with family they don't always get to see. This is my first Christmas with just me and my partner. Since our daughter is getting ready to pop out any day now we stayed up here in Boston. Luckily with modern technologies we've been able to facetime our family and talk to our loved ones.\n\nI saw this post today and it hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1607030793838149633&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis is the key to a functioning society. Being able to have mutual exchange that benefits both parties. Unnecessary third parties prevent that. Bitcoin fixes it.\n\n12/25/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
