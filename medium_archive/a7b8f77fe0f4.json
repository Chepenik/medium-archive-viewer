  "content": "# Day 1107\n\nToday, I watched the film _Mickey 17_ with my love. It was a captivating experience, and I couldn't help but reflect on the thought-provoking themes it presented. Having enjoyed _Parasite_ from the same director, Bong Joon Ho, I knew I was in for something intriguing.\n\nThe movie explores the ethical dilemma of 3D printing humans and the concept of being \"expendable.\" It left me questioning how I would feel in that position. Personally, I don't think I would sign up to be considered \"expendable\". It is a very haunting idea. The film's unique take on human replication made me think about what it truly means to be irreplaceable.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Ek2KiE0yPZq85DorBC_CpA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*jaw8O-LY_jvMIgVrj3Uejg.png)\n\nIt was a compelling watch.\n\n4/2/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
