Crushed some exercise this morning. Read my daily chapter and did my Replit 100 days of code in the AM.\n\nNow I'm writing this Medium and it's going to be another short one.\n\nI do have some things I'd like to write about in the coming weeks. So I'm just going to use the rest of today's Medium to brainstorm.\n\n- How ridiculous it is BNY Melon got the green light to custody Bitcoin as a bank but not Custodia see here:\n\n![[https://x.com/JoeConsorti/status/1837218846882599292](https://x.com/JoeConsorti/status/1837218846882599292)](https://miro.medium.com/1*AjjltIWqzU9O_pfCbuzaOg.png)\n\n- Why comparing yourself to others is a recipe for being unhappy.\n\n- Why Family is the most important institution ever created.\n\n- Continuing to clown the weak ass kleptocrats in power. I love doing that because those people deserved to be mocked and ridiculed - F*** those petty tyrants.\n\n- Discussing Nicole's story of waking up from the woke propaganda here is the video I watched where I learned of this story\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FV4hoNaxVSwA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV4hoNaxVSwA&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FV4hoNaxVSwA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n- The story reminded me of this meme\n\n![[https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1519851044666183681](https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1519851044666183681)](https://miro.medium.com/1*sZbx_QZxXM5HdKHltQvS6g.png)\n\n9/20/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
