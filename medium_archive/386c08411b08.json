  "content": "# Day 991\n\nPatience is a virtue that's easy to claim but hard to maintain when truly tested. It's one thing to feel patient during a calm, relaxing day and quite another when you've spent three hours trying to put a restless child to sleep.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Z86efsH_yKEqdDFzjN233w.png)\n\nIt's in these tough moments that patience matters most. Give yourself permission to pause, breathe, and remember that everything is temporary. One day, you'll look back longingly on the days when your child was small and could rest peacefully in your arms. Gain perspective by asking yourself if today's problem will matter in ten years. More often than not, the answer is no.\n\nI've been reading _Don't Sweat the Small Stuff_, and one of its most valuable lessons is the importance of letting go of the need to always be right. Take a moment before you respond. Literally take a deep breathe before you express yourself with words. This habit can help free you from the compulsion to prove others wrong.\n\nThese principles pair naturally with patience. There are countless ways to interpret a situation, and since systems are intricate, what we think we know often isn't the whole story. As Mark Twain astutely observed, \"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.\"\n\nSo stay humble. Keep stacking sats and practicing quality virtues like patience. Because patience, especially when it's running thin, is the key to remaining relaxed. To make sure you don't kill yourself early from excess cortisol. As far as I can tell, that's an important part of living a good life.\n\n12/7/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
