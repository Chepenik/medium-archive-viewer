  "content": "# Day 1037\n\nI really need to start _dinner party maxing_ more often. Tonight, we had over a lovely couple who have a daughter about Sloan's age, and honestly, it was a blast. There's something special about breaking bread with friends. Sharing good food, better conversation, and bonding over the beautiful chaos that is parenting toddlers.\n\nThe highlight of the night? The husband casually asked me about Bitcoin, which, of course, was my signal to dive headfirst into full nerd mode. I rolled out my well-polished TED Talk on why this so-called _magic internet money_ isn't just a fad, but rather the future of money itself. He listened intently, nodding along, probably questioning if I was in a cult, but to his credit, he seemed genuinely curious.\n\nHis takeaway? Just buy some and hold it for the long haul. Honestly, solid strategy. I told him learning _about_ Bitcoin is key because of it's tendency to swing rapidly up and down. Hard to handle that kind of volatility if you don't know what you own. Luckily, he seemed to have the right instinct: get in, stay in, and don't check the price every 15 minutes. He said whatever he does he just wants to hold onto it long term and check the price in 15 years. I know for a fact (well 99.99% sure anyways) if he can do that with Bitcoin he will come out okay. So I sent him some links like [the Saylor Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2jAZ0x9H0bQFY6wIbQfnrnIlqMcSHd6X) and my copy of the Bitcoin Standard to start him down the rabbit hole.\n\nAll in all, a great evening. Definitely need to do more dinner parties in 2025. Life is better when you break bread with good people.\n\n![Down Ze Rabbit Hole](https://miro.medium.com/1*8X1kwsS6rwB_UFj0nHgIlg.png)\n\n1/22/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
