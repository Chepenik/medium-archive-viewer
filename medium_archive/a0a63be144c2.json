Humanity is living through some wild times. We have tyrannical leaders trying to shut down social media apps like Twitter in Brazil because they can't handle freedom of speech. While it's commendable that Elon Musk is fighting back to keep Twitter (or X) alive, what we really need is a protocol-based solution that nobody can control. Thank God for Bitcoin.\n\n![[https://x.com/liz_churchill10/status/1777048686008135915](https://x.com/liz_churchill10/status/1777048686008135915)](https://miro.medium.com/1*kcRUviCRjix5buPwMUWLwA.png)\n\nThese tyrants have so much power to issue draconian decrees because they control the issuance of fiat currency - money that literally derives its name from a Latin phrase meaning \"by decree.\" Imagine how much better the world could be if people had money that works harder for them than a caffeine-addled Wall Street banker. That's literally life with Bitcoin if you can stomach the volatility and let financial norms get flipped on their head. With a money that has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, your currency goes from inflationary to deflationary and comes with the cutting-edge security of cryptography.\n\nThis isn't just about Bitcoin being a good investment - though it has outperformed every other asset under the sun. It's about embracing a sovereign way of saving, free from the control of any central authority. Those wise enough to opt out of the rapidly devaluing fiat system will find sanctuary, while others will face painful lessons. Bitcoin stands as a beacon of financial freedom, underpinned by a transparent, steadfast monetary policy devoid of any manipulative central planners.\n\n**The Unbreachable Fortress of Bitcoin**\n\nThe Bitcoin network boasts a security apparatus that puts Fort Knox to shame. It has been an unassailable digital fortress since its inception. Despite being in the wild, exposed to the relentless scrutiny of hackers worldwide, its decentralized architecture has remained inviolate, proving to be an enigma that defies unauthorized infiltration. In stark contrast, traditional banking systems, with their antiquated security protocols, are constantly exposed by breaches, struggling to fortify their digital ramparts against evolving cyber threats. Bitcoin, however, continues to uphold its integrity with impeccable resilience, akin to a prom king whose reputation remains untarnished amidst a firestorm of high school drama. This digital titan has consistently repelled assaults with a nonchalant grace, solidifying its status as a historical vanguard of cyber security.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*eNoOeCxadvqNSI3Wf4Umyw.png)\n\n**Inflationary Fiat**\n\nIn stark contrast, fiat currencies like the US dollar have rapidly declined in purchasing power, causing your hard-earned savings to evaporate. On top of requiring permission, fiat loses value over extended periods. It's literally the opposite of Bitcoin when you zoom out. Fiat is not permissionless and depreciates if held for a long time. When central bankers meddle with the money supply through an opaque process controlled by a small group of insiders, the fiat financial system reveals its archaic and manipulated nature with every crisis. Working for dollars or other fiat currencies means essentially working for money that can be created out of thin air by a select few. It's unjust, and humanity deserves better.\n\n**Thriving With The Bitcoin Lifestyle**\n\nIntegrating Bitcoin into your daily life is like upgrading from a horse-and-buggy to a modern SUV. You'll not only protect your purchasing power long-term, but add technological empowerment to your money. Using Bitcoin has an indescribably liberating quality that no fiat stack can match.\n\nManaging wealth in Bitcoin is like hiring the most trustworthy, incorruptible security team to guard your life's work. Because at its core, Bitcoin is the hardest, most ethically-sourced money ever created.\n\nWhile fiat gets inflated away and physical assets can be seized through violence or force, Bitcoin is different. It's purely digital, yet scarce - secured by world-class cryptography and a distributed global network. And since new bitcoin can only be introduced through a computational work proces of providing value, it aligns human behavior in a way that enables flourishing. Rather than being rooted in coercion, Bitcoin incentivizes serving others willingly.\n\nDon't resign yourself to participating in a financial system that impoverishes humanity. With tyrants striving to control information and leaders debasing money itself, cast off those rusty, authoritarian shackles. It's time to embrace the future - a Bitcoin lifestyle of freedom, ethics, and prosperity.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*REnj4pvUnDE6c0MUK3NXAQ.png)\n\n4/7/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
