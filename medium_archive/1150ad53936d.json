Sure enough though that is exactly what Joe and Katt did when I listened to this podcast.\n\nWorth the listen. Glad to see Joe can post the whole pod on Youtube as well. Doesn't hurt either the Youtube comment section remains undefeated.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*CzJmgKeN75IAmiwYEILMHQ.png)\n\nOne of the best pieces of advice given in the podcast is that the more you learn the more you realize the less you truly know. Also that time is circular and you can learn a lot about what will happen in the future based on the patterns of the past. The pod also made me want to get this book so I bought it off Amazon.\n\n> [**The Emerald Tablet of Hermes**](https://amzn.to/3V1roAH)\n\n3/2/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
