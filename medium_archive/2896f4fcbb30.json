  "content": "Day 696\n\nI recall a humorous tweet mocking those frustrated with boomers for purchasing homes that would triple in value over two to three decades. The tweet contrasted this with Bitcoin enthusiasts of the present, who have the opportunity to see their investments increase tenfold in a significantly shorter timeframe. It's all about perspective. I feel fortunate to witness the monetization of what could be described as a miraculous, Internet-based monetary protocol.\n\nDon't over think this anon. Stack sats, eat meat, and never sell your BTC. Instead take it into cold storage so you can lose it in a boating accident.\n\nYou can thank me later!\n\n2/16/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
