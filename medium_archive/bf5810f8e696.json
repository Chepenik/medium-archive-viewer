  "content": "# Day 593\n\nToday one of my favorite Bitcoiners randomly tweeted about my video. Max Keiser is a serious Bitcoin OG who has been recommending people buy bitcoin since it was one dollar.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1721299301324759055%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nThis post gave me the motivation to finally do a read of the constitution I wrote for sovereign individuals. Will share it when I finish editing but all the reading is complete.\n\nYou never know when life is going to throw you a bone so keep going. It is hard to put into words how cool it feels to be shouted out by one of your favorite Bitcoiners. Whatever you're working on, don't give up anon!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*_W5OmreAU1DpdFVC)\n\nOur influence can spread further than we know. While it may sound trite, the truth remains that each of us has the power to dramatically impact this world. Do not underestimate the far-reaching ripples even small acts can have. Use your time on this earth thoughtfully, purposefully creating ripples that leave things better. Even a pebble makes waves when dropped in still waters. With thoughtful action, we can be the pebble that starts a wave of positive change.\n\n11/5/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
