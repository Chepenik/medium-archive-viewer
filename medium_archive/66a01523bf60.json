One theme persistently resonates with me: the importance of nurturing strong relationships as the cornerstone of true happiness.\n\nThis belief was powerfully affirmed when I recently ended a 72-hour fast by enjoying steak, potatoes, limeade, and ice cream with my family. In their company, I was reminded of the priceless value of these bonds and how the simple act of sharing a meal can bring immense joy and fulfillment. I felt deeply grateful to have these moments with my loved ones.\n\nFasting, though beneficial in many ways, can be a real challenge. It strips away the everyday pleasures we often overlook. During this period, I managed to run eight miles over three days. I look back on this achievement with pride. However, the effort left me grumpy and irritable, highlighting how important nourishment is not just for my body but also for my mental well-being. Next time, I won't run while fasting. This particular fast gave me a persistent headache, unlike my other fasts. Lesson learned.\n\nEvery time I fast, I realize how much meals and social interactions bring joy to my life. While social interactions don't disappear during a fast, it's harder to enjoy them when you're grumpy and have a headache. Many of our social interactions revolve around meals or enjoying a coffee together. These routines are an essential part of life that provide comfort, joy, and a sense of belonging. When these elements are missing, life can feel bleak.\n\nI'm glad I did the fast because it reminded me of the value of discipline and physical endurance. Yet, what stands out the most is that true fulfillment lies in the relationships we have. It's in the simple, shared experiences that we find happiness. Humans are social creatures. Taking a break from things, whether it's one's vices or something as crucial as food, can give you a much deeper appreciation for them. By pushing our limits, we can strive to be our best selves, but we must never lose sight of what truly matters. Just as money is a means to an end, fasting serves a greater purpose. It helps me to be healthier, allows my body to heal, and teaches me to appreciate food more. It's not just about the act of not eating; it's about gaining a deeper understanding and gratitude for the essentials of life.\n\n6/30/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
