  "content": "# Day 624\n\n![Philosophizing](https://miro.medium.com/0*S2WM95Nt0qFeIR23)\n\nToday I got to have dinner and spend time with some of my best friends. It was a real treat to hang out with the kids who I spent so much time in high school with. Adulting has its perks but it also makes it hard to catch up with your buddies because everyone gets busy with adulting things.\n\nWhat we discussed for a long time tonight was selfishness vs selflessness & individualism vs collectivism. These topics, I believe, intertwine in intriguing ways. For instance, while prioritizing the collective may appear selfless, it could also stem from a selfish desire to be esteemed by the group. Conversely, an individual focusing on personal growth could be seen as selfless, as they forgo immediate pleasures for the greater good of the collective. This self-improvement, while seemingly selfish, ultimately enhances the collective by cultivating a more capable individual.\n\nThis topic is paradoxical. It often seems the opposite of what people expect that leads to the best outcome. One of the points my friends made tonight was don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. I asked him to elaborate because that didn't make sense to me. He went on to talk about how there is a big difference between someone donating anonymously vs someone who donates and then goes and tells everyone about it.\n\nThis reflection led me to a realization: the long-standing debate between selfish and selfless acts is intriguing, yet it's the underlying intention that truly defines an act's nature. The act of donating money is such a good example. The gesture has elements of both selflessness and selfishness. Selflessness is evident when the donor parts with funds they could have used for personal needs. Yet, there's an inherent selfishness too, rooted in the gratification one feels from giving. This isn't inherently negative; after all, selfishness isn't always deserving of its pejorative associations.\n\nIf someone donates to a humanitarian cause at face value it seems predominantly selfless. However, when scrutinized, the shades of selfishness emerge if the act brings personal joy or societal approval. It is important to note absolutes are rare in life and I have not been able to find a think of a truly selfless act. Hence, labeling an act as purely selfless or selfish doesn't fully capture its moral standing. What matters more is the donor's primary intent. Is it to drive positive change, or to garner admiration, often termed as 'virtue signaling'?\n\nIn essence, if the intention is genuine & aims to foster positive change, then the act leans towards being morally commendable. Conversely, if it's primarily about seeking validation or applause, it veers into morally negative territory. Intent, rather than the act itself, becomes the decisive factor in this moral equation.\n\nWhile philosophy may not be the most financially rewarding major, it offers a wealth of intellectual exploration and endless conversation topics. The pursuit of answers to deep questions, those that can consume a lifetime without resolution, holds immense value. One of my favorite philosophical paradoxes highlights this very point: gaining an answer often leads to a cascade of ten new questions. This is a positive outcome, as knowing the right questions to ask is half the battle.\n\n12/6/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
