  "content": "# Day 264\n\nSnowed up in Boston today for the first time this winter. Feels like a true winter wonderland. Went to my buddies today to watch football. I'm so impressed with how good the Eagles are this year. Jalen Hurts looks like an absolute stud and is so well poised. Fingers crossed we keep it together in the playoffs this year.\n\nBefore going to southie for the day I went and posted this sticker in Cambridge to spread the good word of Bitcoin. I didn't put the sticker below it but I'm grateful to whoever did. It makes the Bitcoin sticker more noticeable.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/conorchepenik/status/1601966577343205377&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n[Bitcoin.rocks](https://bitcoin.rocks/) is a dope website. The network effects of this thing continue to blow my mind day after day.\n\nAnyways, it's a lazy Sunday. I'm going to get do some pushups and hug my girlfriend. Take a second to reflect on what you are grateful for anon. Life moves too fast and before you know it you will be old and looking back on your life!\n\n12/11/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
