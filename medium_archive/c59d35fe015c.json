  "content": "# Day 1186\n\nI bought a Zen garden. It's a small tiny one for my living room, but it's nice. One day I'm going to have a massive, real one in my backyard. They are so beautiful. So serene.\n\nI was driving today and noticed how gorgeous the trees were in the sunlight. It's a route I've taken many times, but for some reason today it just looked so pretty in the bright light. Not much changed, other than my perspective.\n\nMany such cases throughout life. We don't appreciate all the amazing things we have because we are preoccupied with bullshit. So stop, remind yourself that your time here is fleeting, that your Creator graced you with a presence on this Earth, and make sure to smell the roses every opportunity you get.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*iA1wRQ6FWthVLbWlOP96lg.png)\n\n6/20/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
