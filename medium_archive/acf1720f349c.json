  "content": "# Day 1138\n\nMillions of Americans are sitting on mountains of home equity right now. Most will waste it. \nA few will escape the fiat trap.\n\nLet's break down: → Cash Out Refinances → Home Equity Loans → HELOCs ...and why Bitcoin might be the smartest investment of all\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*HPFJ64Ivb1Stlbf8)\n\nOwnership is an illusion.\n\nSad but true.\n\nYou don't really own your house. \nEven if your mortgage hits $0, stop paying property taxes and see who shows up.\n\nYou're renting from Uncle Sam... indefinitely. \nProperty taxes → the government's guaranteed cut. \nAnd that's by design.\n\nMortgages make this worse. \nDebt + taxes = the perfect fiat trap.\n\nUncle Sam wants you in a 30-year mortgage: \n→ Keeps you paying taxes\n→ Keeps you paying interest\n→ Keeps you locked in fiat land\n\nYour house feels like an asset. But in many ways, it's a leash.\n\nWhat if you flipped the script?\n\nWhat if you used your trapped equity strategically, not recklessly, to escape the very system designed to trap you?\n\nSome will choose to leave home equity untouched → enjoying the peace of a paid-off home.\n\nOthers may carefully tap it → turning fiat-denominated value into Bitcoin → and letting time do the heavy lifting.\n\nNeither is right or wrong. It all depends on your personal balance between freedom from worry and desire to go long Bitcoin.\n\nIf you prefer the latter here are 3 options if you already have a mortgage:\n\nCash Out Refinance → Replace + Extract\n\nReplaces your old mortgage with a bigger new one. \n→ Pay off the old loan \n→ Pocket the difference as cash \n→ Restart the clock (new term + interest)\n\nBest when rates are lower than you current ones. \nAlso new closing costs. \nBe careful.\n\nHome Equity Loan → Second Fixed Loan Keep your old mortgage.\n\nAdd a second loan → lump sum cash → fixed payments. \nPredictable. \nSimple.\n\nBut now you have TWO debts. Not ideal in a rising rate world.\n\nUse fiat debt to buy pristine assets\n\nIf debt is cheap and equity sits idle... \n→ Use it strategically \n→ Borrow against melting fiat \n→ Buy Bitcoin \n→ Hold for years\n\nThis is what smart money does. Use bad money → buy good money.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*suiWl9oV8BbfIEwy)\n\nBut leverage is NOT a game. Borrowing against your house to buy Bitcoin is serious.\n\n→ Rates can rise \n→ Bitcoin can dip \n→ Real estate can fall\n\nYou're playing with fire.\n\nRespect the risk. Understand the upside. Act with discipline.\n\nThe ultimate play? \nDepends on your situation.\n\nBelieve in Bitcoin long-term? \n→ Take on long duration debt \n→ Buy bitcoin \n→ Slowly repay that debt with debasing dollars\n\nTis' asymmetric warfare against fiat.\n\nDone right → extremely powerful. \nDone recklessly → dangerous.\n\nNow, let me be brutally honest. I considered taking out a HELOC to buy Bitcoin. I'm confident it would work but also aware it adds stress, complexity, and risk to my life.\n\nThat's why I'm likely passing. \nPeace of mind matters more. \nThis thread is me thinking it through.\n\nBitcoin is freedom.\n\nBut freedom is not just financial. It's also sleeping soundly, not sweating debt or dancing with markets you don't control. Play fiat games, win fiat prizes.\n\nDebt is a chain, not a key to sovereignty.\n\nYour home equity is powerful. Used wisely, it can help you break free. Used recklessly, it can bind you tighter than before. If you can borrow modestly and hold Bitcoin for 5+ years → odds favor you.\n\nBut simplicity often wins.\n\nSometimes the strongest move is: → Stay humble → Avoid leverage → Stack Bitcoin → Let time work its magic\n\nSovereignty isn't about being clever. \nIt's about peace of mind and freedom from worry. \nChoose wisely.\n\n**So TL;DR as tempting as it is to lever up to increase my BTC stack, I don't think the extra debt is worth the stress. Leverage is borrowing happiness from the future and sometimes, the future defaults. Best to simply stay humble and stack sats.**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*p_HsYgMt72GmwOxy)\n\n5/3/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
