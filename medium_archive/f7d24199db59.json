  "content": "# Day 379\n\nI used Bard to generate me a prompt then I put that into chatGPT and then I used this poem it spit out to get another prompt for the image. Usually I wouldn't just post a poem for my daily Medium, but this one made me happy so here it is :)\n\nAmidst the hills and valleys green, The world is like a magic dream. Where streams flow and rivers sing, And birds take to the sky on wing.\n\nThe sun casts its golden rays, As the flowers bloom in different ways, Their petals soft and colors bright, A symphony of beauty in plain sight.\n\nThe forests rustle in the breeze, As the leaves whisper melodies, And the scent of pine fills the air, Nature's magic is everywhere.\n\nFrom mountain peaks to ocean floors, Nature's beauty forever soars, A world of wonders to behold, A treasure chest of stories untold.\n\nSo let us cherish this natural gem, For it's a part of who we are and when, We stand in awe of the world we see, A place of beauty, forever free.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Gh1tvEybs7hAVR9N)\n\n4/5/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
