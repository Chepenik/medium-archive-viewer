  "content": "# Day 461\n\nToday someone asked me how my morning was and I said good I made some coffee. They asked what kind and I said with honey. They mentioned they had never tried coffee that way but that it might be worthwhile to give it a shot. I asked them about their day and they mentioned it was great because they journaled in the morning.\n\nRespect. Journaling everyday is so important. Honing your thought, sharpening your pencils. Metaphorically speaking because I just be typing for my daily journals. Although it might be worthwhile to actually write on paper sometimes. Feels good doing things the analog way. I prefer reading a book to my computer. Usually I'm watching con⛺ ️on my phone. Hahahaha content with a tent emoji always cracks me up I don't know why.\n\nFind the joy in the little things in life. Go for a walk. Spread some love. Participate in value 4 value.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*JjR28eDI8up0BE4wZ0vNyw.png)\n\nMake weird AI generated art. Life is about experimenting baby!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*07Uqf6Jj4Pdc0a6EUfJrsQ.png)\n\nI'm also creating a new MassAdoption website and playing with designs. Feels good to try and harness my inner child. Lot to learn from my little one who observes things with a sense of wonder.\n\nWhoever you may be reading this anon I wish you nothing but peace in love. Life is hard but it's worth every second. You matter. You are amazing. You are going to succeed at whatever goals you have.\n\n6/26/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
