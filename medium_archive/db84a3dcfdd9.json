They were soft-spoken men of means and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more. Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: 'For the support of this declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\"\n\nI want to keep this in mind as I write my own. Achieving liberty is not going to be easy but it is an endeavor worth pursuing.\n\nI'm going to use the next 7 days on this Medium to try and win 25 grand. So if you get tired of reading new drafts of the same thing over and over maybe wait till day 571 to check back in. Here is a link to the competition in which I have decided to compete.\n\n> [**The Constitution of Consent (Contest) $25,000**](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/the-constitution-of-consent-contest)\n\n**A Declaration For Sovereign Individuals In The Digital Age**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis Constitution is a bold experiment in liberty, designed to protect individual rights and local self-governance for all time. We recognize that fiat decrees alone are insufficient to prevent the centralization of power, so we have focused on aligning incentives to thwart any corrupting influence on our leaders. We, the people of the world, unite behind this charter to nurture our core values and safeguard its principles for millennia. May it secure the blessings of independence and self-determination for all.\n\n**Preamble**\n\nWe, the citizens of Earth, recognize our inalienable natural rights and commit to the enduring principles of peace, freedom, justice, entrepreneurship, and prosperity. We establish this Constitution of Consent to safeguard these principles for all, both present and future. By aligning incentives to prevent the accumulation and abuse of power, we ensure that the flame of liberty burns brightly for millennia to come. We will achieve this by using technology as a tool to liberate humanity rather than to control it.\n\n**Article I: Fundamental Rights**\n\nAll individuals possess inherent and inalienable rights, including the right to life, liberty, property, privacy, and the pursuit of their own self-interest. These rights are inviolable and form the bedrock of our society, safeguarded against infringement by any entity, including the government. However, these rights are not absolute and come with the responsibility of not violating someone else's private property without their consent.\n\nThe government's primary duty is to protect these rights, and it shall never infringe upon them except when necessary to prevent harm to others. This limitation ensures that government intervention is only justified when individual actions pose a clear and imminent threat to the rights and safety of others.\n\nFurthermore, our society upholds the principle of equality under the law. Every individual, regardless of their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or any other attribute, shall be treated with equal respect and dignity by the government in all public matters. Discrimination on any basis is strictly prohibited, reaffirming our commitment to justice and fairness in the public sphere.\n\nHowever, we also recognize the importance of individual freedom in private matters. In the realm of personal associations and relationships, individuals have the right to associate freely with whomever they choose, in accordance with their personal beliefs and preferences. This recognition ensures that individuals retain their autonomy in private interactions, while public institutions remain committed to upholding the principles of fairness and non-discrimination in the broader society.\n\nIn the spirit of promoting a robust and open society, freedom of speech, press, assembly, and petition shall not be abridged. These rights are essential for the free exchange of ideas, the pursuit of knowledge, and the peaceful expression of dissent. They ensure that every citizen has a voice and a platform to advocate for their beliefs, contributing to the vibrant tapestry of our democratic society.\n\nBy recognizing and upholding these fundamental rights, we establish a society where individual liberties are cherished, government power is limited, and all citizens are equal before the law. These principles are the cornerstone of our commitment to justice, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness for every member of our society, both in public and private life.\n\n**Article II: Limited Government**\n\nIn our vision of governance, the power vested in the government is a tool carefully crafted to serve the interests of the people, and it shall be wielded sparingly and with utmost restraint. The fundamental principle guiding our nation is the limitation of government power to the absolute minimum required for the preservation of individual rights and the well-being of our society.\n\nThe primary role of the government is to secure and protect the inherent rights of every individual, including life, liberty, property, privacy, and the pursuit of happiness. Government intervention into the lives of citizens shall only be justified when necessary to prevent harm or violations of these rights. This limitation ensures that the government's reach remains minimal, and individual freedoms remain inviolate.\n\nFurthermore, our constitution prohibits the enactment of laws that grant special privileges or exemptions to government officials or any other group within our society. The rule of law applies equally to all, without exception or favoritism. This ensures that no individual or group is above the law and that justice is blind to all distinctions except the merits of each case.\n\nTransparency and accountability are the cornerstones of our limited government. All government actions, decisions, and expenditures shall be conducted openly and made accessible to the public. This transparency ensures that citizens have the information they need to hold their government accountable for its actions. Government officials are bound by a duty to explain and justify their actions to the people they serve.\n\nFurthermore, we recognize the vital role of an informed citizenry in preserving the principles of limited government. A well-informed populace is essential for upholding the integrity of our constitutional order and for holding government officials accountable. In the absence of secrecy and obfuscation, the people can exercise their civic duty and engage in the democratic process effectively.\n\nIn sum, our commitment to limited government is rooted in the belief that the power of the state should be wielded judiciously and with the utmost respect for individual rights. Our government exists solely to protect and preserve these rights, refraining from undue intrusion into the lives and affairs of its citizens. Through transparency, accountability, and the rule of law, we ensure that government power remains a servant of the people rather than a master, safeguarding the principles of liberty and justice upon which our nation was founded.\n\n**Article III: Prohibition of Cronyism**\n\nIn our constitutional framework, we hold the principle of free markets as a cornerstone of our economic system. We affirm the fundamental right of individuals to own property, engage in trade, start businesses, and innovate without unwarranted interference from the government or any external entity. The bedrock of our economic philosophy is the promotion and protection of open and competitive markets.\n\nIndividuals are granted the freedom to own and manage their property as they see fit, whether it be real estate, businesses, or personal possessions. This property rights guarantee empowers individuals to make decisions about their resources and investments based on their own interests and values.\n\nWe recognize that open and competitive markets are essential for economic vitality and innovation. Therefore, it is the duty of the government to foster an environment where competition thrives. Monopolistic practices, collusion, and any form of anticompetitive behavior are strictly prohibited.\n\nTo underscore our unwavering commitment to preventing cronyism and preserving the integrity of our free markets, we institute severe consequences for government officials and businesses engaged in such activities. Any government official found guilty of colluding with private businesses for personal gain shall face a minimum sentence of ten years in prison, immediate removal from office, and forfeiture of all government benefits and pensions.\n\nBusinesses involved in cronyism shall be shut down, their assets seized, and their executives prosecuted. In cases of severe and deliberate collusion, where the harm to the public and the economy is egregious, individuals involved may face life imprisonment or the death penalty, as determined by due process of law.\n\nCronyism, defined as any undue collaboration or favoritism between government and business entities, is unequivocally forbidden. Our constitution establishes a clear separation between the government and the private sector to prevent the concentration of power and the distortion of market forces. Public officials and government agencies are barred from extending special privileges or advantages to any business or individual.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to free markets extends to protecting property rights, intellectual property, and contracts. These protections ensure that individuals and businesses can invest, innovate, and engage in transactions with confidence, knowing that their rights and agreements are legally upheld.\n\nIn essence, our dedication to free markets is rooted in the belief that economic freedom and competition are essential for individual prosperity, innovation, and economic growth. Through this constitutional principle, we seek to create an environment where individuals are free to pursue their economic interests, where businesses thrive based on merit, and where the government's role is limited to safeguarding the integrity of the market and protecting the rights of its citizens. We consider any act of cronyism to be a grave offense against the principles of justice and the well-being of our society, and those convicted of such acts shall be held as traitors of our state.\n\n**Article IV: Technology and Privacy**\n\nIn our constitutional framework, we recognize the paramount importance of safeguarding the rights of individuals in an era of advancing technology. We affirm the unalienable right of individuals to utilize technology for peaceful and lawful purposes. Moreover, we hold privacy in personal data, communications, and devices as sacrosanct.\n\n**4.1: Right to Technological Freedom**\n\n**4.1.1 Technological Freedom:** Every individual possesses the inherent right to utilize technology freely for peaceful and lawful purposes. This right includes the ability to access, use, and innovate with technological tools and resources without undue interference or restriction.\n\n**4.1.2 Innovation and Progress:** Our society promotes technological innovation and progress. Individuals, businesses, and organizations are encouraged to contribute to the development of technology for the betterment of society, subject to ethical and legal constraints.\n\n**4.2:** Privacy Protection\n\n**4.2.1** Privacy Rights: Privacy in personal data, communications, and devices shall be held inviolable. Individuals have the inherent right to control access to their personal information, safeguard their communications, and maintain the security of their devices.\n\n**4.2.2** Surveillance Restrictions: Surveillance conducted by government agencies or any other entities shall only be permissible with specific warrants obtained through due process of law. These warrants must demonstrate probable cause and adhere to strict legal standards. Unauthorized and unwarranted surveillance is strictly prohibited. Violations of this law will be considered treasonous just like cronyism.\n\n**4.3: Prohibition of Invasive Surveillance Technologies**\n\n**4.3.1.** Scope of Prohibition: Within our jurisdiction, the use of technologies, systems, or devices designed for or capable of invasive surveillance that infringes upon personal privacy, violates the principles of due process, or enables widespread and indiscriminate data collection is strictly prohibited.\n\n**4.3.2.** Definition of Invasive Surveillance: Invasive surveillance technologies refer to tools or practices that intrude upon an individual's privacy rights, such as unauthorized data collection, monitoring, or tracking of personal information, without the explicit and informed consent of the affected parties.\n\n**4.3.3.** Ethical and Legitimate Use: This prohibition does not extend to technologies, including widely used devices such as smartphones and computers, when they are employed for ethical and legitimate purposes, consistent with established legal frameworks and respect for individual privacy rights.\n\nThrough this constitutional article, we affirm our commitment to striking a delicate balance between technological advancement and individual privacy. We acknowledge that technology can empower individuals, enhance our lives, and foster progress, but it also has the potential to intrude upon our personal liberties.\n\nWe enshrine the right to technological freedom, emphasizing that individuals should be free to explore, create, and utilize technology without unwarranted restrictions. Moreover, we uphold the sanctity of privacy, recognizing that personal data, communications, and devices are extensions of an individual's private domain.\n\nOur stance on surveillance underscores the importance of due process and accountability. Surveillance may only be conducted when it is warranted by specific circumstances and approved through established legal procedures.\n\nBy strictly prohibiting technologies that enable mass surveillance, we reaffirm our commitment to protecting the privacy and civil liberties of our citizens. We believe that a society where technology and privacy coexist harmoniously is one where individuals can fully enjoy the benefits of technological progress while retaining their fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\n**V Local Governance: Empowering Communities**\n\nIn our commitment to a government that truly serves its citizens, we embrace the principle of decentralized governance. We believe that government power should be brought as close to the people as possible, allowing local communities the autonomy to shape their destinies, provided they uphold the rights of all individuals. Our vision for governance emphasizes local control, experimentation, and innovation over central planning and excessive regulation.\n\n**5.1 Decentralization of Power**\n\n**5.1.1. Empowering Local Communities:** We recognize that local communities possess unique insights into their needs, preferences, and values. Therefore, we advocate for the decentralization of government power, enabling communities to make decisions that directly impact their residents.\n\n**5.1.2.** Respect for Individual Rights: While local governance is encouraged, it is imperative that such autonomy does not infringe upon the fundamental rights of individuals. Every citizen's rights, as outlined in Article I, shall remain inviolable, regardless of the level of government.\n\n**5.2 Local Control and Innovation**\n\n**5.2.1. Freedom to Govern:** Local communities have the freedom to govern themselves in ways that align with their specific aspirations and values. This freedom extends to matters of policy, public services, and community development.\n\n**5.2.2. Experimentation and Innovation:** We champion the spirit of experimentation and innovation at the local level. Communities are encouraged to explore new approaches to governance, fostering a dynamic environment where successful solutions can be shared and replicated.\n\n**5.3 Minimal Centralization**\n\n**5.3.1. Limiting Centralization:** While local governance is at the core of our principles, we understand that certain issues may necessitate centralized coordination. However, such centralization shall be minimal, with the focus remaining on empowering local communities.\n\n**5.3.2. Balancing Interests:** In cases where the interests of multiple communities intersect, our constitution ensures a framework for cooperation and conflict resolution that respects the autonomy of each community involved. Decisions must be reached through consensus among the involved communities, with local representatives facilitating discussions and negotiations. Transparency, public participation, and respect for individual rights are paramount throughout the process, ensuring that the autonomy of each community is upheld.\n\nBy promoting decentralized governance, we aim to enhance the democratic process, encourage local innovation, and preserve the diverse tapestry of our nation. This approach allows for a more responsive government that respects the unique character of each community while upholding the rights and freedoms of every individual.\n\n**Article VI: Adaptive Constitution**\n\nOur Constitution is a dynamic and resilient foundation, designed to adapt to the evolving needs of our society. Amendments will only be considered when unanimous consensus among residents is achieved, ensuring that no change is made without the full consent of those who live within the jurisdiction. We envision a government structured solely to serve the interests of its constituents. We place a premium on extensive public involvement in the governance process, harnessing technology to prevent the unwarranted accumulation of power in any sphere of our society. Just as innovation drives the cost of goods towards marginal production costs, we aspire to a government that becomes progressively less relevant as innovation fosters abundance and prosperity.\n\n**Article VII:**\n\nConsent of the Governed The legitimate authority of government stems from the explicit consent of its citizens. No law shall be binding on any individual without their voluntary, informed, and revocable consent. Silence or inaction shall imply consent only when new amendments to this constitution are proposed, with residents having the responsibility to voice their dissent if they oppose a new amendment. Majority rule shall never infringe upon the rights and freedoms of minorities without their explicit consent. No collective entity, be it government, corporations, or other organizations, shall possess rights superior to those of individuals. Individual consent shall be a prerequisite for any collective action or policy affecting individuals. Leveraging technology, we shall maximize individual participation, transparency, and real-time consent in governance. Citizens shall enjoy accessible and secure means to propose, discuss, and vote on policies affecting them. As technology advances, representative democracy shall evolve toward direct democracy. To safeguard consent, any erosion of liberty, transparency, or accountability shall trigger automatic reform processes, temporarily decentralizing power until the consent of the governed is reaffirmed.\n\n10/6/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
