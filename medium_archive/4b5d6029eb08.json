  "content": "# Day 999\n\nThere is so much value in giving. It feels really good to help others. That's why Christmas is such an amazing holiday.\n\nTonight my Grandpa offered a beautiful prayer at dinner before the family ate beef stew. I even got some pistachio ice cream with chocolate chips for dessert. One of my personal favorites.\n\nSince I will be traveling north for Christmas I decided to give my Grandparents gifts early. These gifts included 3D printed ones and they loved them. It's amazing that I can just make these little trinkets inside my home so easily thanks to Bambu Labs.\n\n![Not the actual gifts I gave but close](https://miro.medium.com/1*ag8JWctuHLX-3EfDGiBhcg.png)\n\nFeels good. Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa, Happy New Year, and Festivus for the Rest of Us who enjoy Seinfeld.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*rO59A4RBAKuuHFRZ.jpg)\n\nI hope you have a blessed a joyful winter season anon.\n\n12/15/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
