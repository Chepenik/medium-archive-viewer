Smart, humble, and seemingly man's best friend right now.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed%2Fepisode%2F2ThIfbGXWTxBITTsj18aBw%2Fvideo%3Futm_source%3Doembed&display_name=Spotify&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F2ThIfbGXWTxBITTsj18aBw&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2Fab67656300005f1fa0f362345e0c9531a2ec9b4d&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=spotify\" title=\"\" height=\"351\" width=\"624\"></iframe>\n\nThis rip about spiritual forces is worth the three hours. It made me ask the question, \"what I am going to do about it\". Be a better person? I hope so.\n\nOn an unrelated note I grilled today and becoming a Dad has at least 10x my grilling powers. Amazing.\n\nSloan also got to play with two other girls her age. Was nice hanging with a bunch of girl Dads tonight.\n\n4/21/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
