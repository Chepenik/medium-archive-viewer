  "content": "# Day 256\n\nSpent today with my Grandparent's and got dinner in Davis Sqaure. I'm so blessed to have family who I know loves me dearly.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*6mdmhdxAh-cMWB2Y5wZlHQ.jpeg)\n\nFeels like Sloan is going to be with us anyday now. Amazing how fast these past months have gone by. Tomorrow we are heading up to Portsmouth NH which will be a fun trip. I'm a big fan of the live free or die state. My Grandpa Tommy is super excited because he has never visited New Hampshire.\n\nOne of the things I did today was show my Grandparent's chatGPT and even they were impressed with the AI. I asked it questions about why communism failed and my Grandpa was just sitting there reading it like hell yea. This chat bot is truly incredible. It can code up almost anything you ask it. Hell check this out.\n\nI asked chatGPT, \"Write me a paragraph from a 25 year old who is nervous but excited about becoming a father\"\n\n\"As a 25 year old man, I'm feeling a mix of emotions as I approach the birth of my first child. On the one hand, I'm incredibly nervous about all of the changes and challenges that come along with fatherhood. I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle the lack of sleep, the financial responsibilities, and the constant demand for attention and care. But on the other hand, I'm also incredibly excited about the prospect of becoming a dad and watching my child grow and develop. I can't wait to see their first steps, their first words, and their first smiles, and to be a part of all of the amazing moments that come with raising a child. I know that it won't be easy, but I'm ready to take on this new challenge and to be the best father that I can be.\"\n\nThis was pretty spot on in terms of how I'm feeling. Like scary spot on hahahahaha. I figured if the AI is this good with how I might be feeling as a soon to be father maybe it can help me improve my own relationship with my Dad.\n\nI aksed chatGPT, \"What would you say to your father who is nervous you won't be as successful as he had hoped.\"\n\n\"If my father was feeling nervous that I might not be as successful as he had hoped, I would reassure him that I am doing my best and that success can be measured in many different ways. I would remind him that success isn't just about money or career achievements, but also about happiness, fulfillment, and personal growth. I would assure him that I am pursuing my passions and working hard to achieve my goals, and that I am grateful for the love and support that he has provided throughout my life. I would also encourage him to trust in my abilities and to have faith in my ability to make my own way in the world. Ultimately, I would want him to know that I value and appreciate his concern, and that I will do my best to make him proud.\"\n\nLike holy cow!!! This is fantastic advice and something I've been trying to articulate to my father. I don't want to cheat on these writing posts but I feel like this AI knows exactly what I should be writing so I'd be better off just improving my question skills. The more I use this thing the more I am convinced that AI will replace so many jobs. Which can be good to free humans to focus on other things but also bad for those who don't keep up with the necessary skills needed for this new world. This thing even gives great advice to be a better boyfriend during childbirth.\n\nI asked it, \"What does my pregnant girlfriend need from me as she approaches child birth?\"\n\n\"As your pregnant girlfriend approaches childbirth, she will likely need a variety of things from you. Some of the most important things that you can do to support her during this time include being present and attentive, listening to her needs and concerns, providing emotional and physical support, and helping her to prepare for the arrival of the baby. This might involve attending doctor's appointments and childbirth classes with her, helping her to create a birth plan, and providing practical support such as preparing the home and making sure that she has everything she needs. It's also important to be patient, understanding, and flexible, as pregnancy and childbirth can be unpredictable and can sometimes bring unexpected challenges. By being there for her and providing the support that she needs, you can help her to feel more confident and prepared for the birth of your child.\"\n\nFinally, I had to ask it the hard hitting questions, \"How much time can AI free up for humanity so we can focus on less mundane tasks?\"\n\n\"It's difficult to say exactly how much time AI can free up for humanity, as this will depend on a variety of factors such as the specific tasks that AI is being used for, the efficiency and effectiveness of the AI systems, and the ways in which the time saved is used. However, in general, AI has the potential to automate many routine and repetitive tasks that currently require human labor, which could free up a significant amount of time for people to focus on more interesting, challenging, or rewarding activities. For example, AI can be used to automate tasks such as data entry, scheduling, and customer service, which can save time and reduce the workload for many people. Additionally, AI can be used to assist with more complex tasks such as analysis, decision making, and problem solving, which can help to speed up and improve the quality of these processes. By freeing up time and enabling people to work more efficiently and effectively, AI has the potential to make a significant positive impact on society and to improve the quality of life for many people.\"\n\nThese are too fun. I had to do one more! \"Can you give me some similarities between bitcoin and the bible\"\n\n\"It's not clear to me how Bitcoin and the Bible might have similarities, as they are two very different things. Bitcoin is a digital currency and payment system that uses cryptography to facilitate secure financial transactions, while the Bible is a collection of ancient religious texts that are considered sacred by many people. However, there are a few possible ways in which these two things might be seen as having some similarities. For example, both Bitcoin and the Bible are considered by some to be revolutionary or transformative in their respective fields, and both have sparked debates and discussions about their significance and relevance. Additionally, both have been the subject of much study and interpretation, and both have a dedicated following of enthusiasts who are passionate about their value and importance. However, these are very broad and general similarities, and it's important to remember that Bitcoin and the Bible are fundamentally different things with very different histories, purposes, and meanings.\"\n\nAI is going to change so much. I'm excited for the possibilities and hope more people leverage this technology to help humanity thrive. This thing really does have the ability to increase productivity like never before. The future is going to be interesting.\n\n12/3/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
