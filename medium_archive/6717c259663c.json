  "content": "# Day 523\n\nToday I went to Providence with my family and got to enjoy some beers at the Narragansett brewery. It was a special day getting to spend time with my Dad up here in the northeast.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*A4f3bY7ElUckbiLvO5XizQ.png)\n\nRhode Island is a cool little state. We started chatting about a couple that was local to the area and they gave us some recommendations for places to check out around here. It's always nice hearing from people who actually live in the area.\n\nIt seems like there are a lot of cool lofts, apartments, and shipping container homes in Providence. One day I would like to renovate an old brick building into a loft. Something very comfy to me about the brick and industrial feel of a loft.\n\nThe BnB we got is a loft so that's why I got lofts on my mind. Only complaint about the loft I'm staying in is that I have to work downstairs to use the bathroom. I want a loft with a bathroom on the same floor as my bedroom lol. Even if that means an air open lofted bathroom ðŸ˜‚ .\n\nI'll end today with this excellent tweet. Appreciate your wisdom PBD!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/patrickbetdavid/status/1695873935290564744%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n8/27/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
