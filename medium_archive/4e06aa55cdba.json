I completed my first half marathon, had my first child, and moved from Massachusetts back to the state I grew up.\n\nGod is good. In 2023 I also completed my goal of running at least 40 miles every single month.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1741229499092504835%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI continued to write everyday in 2023 and the proof can be found on this Medium. I did not read 10 pages everyday this year but I did read a lot. One of the things this made me realize is that tracking my habits is important. I still have a lot to do on Habit-Chain but at least I completed the app.\n\nMaybe I will build that app out more as a way to track my habits better. Or I could use a different app. I'll figure it out based on how I do with my goals. I know that posting about it online is a very helpful way to achieve the goals because social pressure is powerful.\n\nHere is to 2024. I'm sharing my goals here and on Twitter to hold myself accountable. As my boy PBD likes to say future is bright!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1741665098601566650%3Fs%3D20&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n12/31/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
