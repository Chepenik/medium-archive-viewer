Consider the jellyfish, [some species of which can theoretically live indefinitely](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/immortal-jellyfish-secret-to-cheating-death.html), yet it is humans, with their intricate and multifaceted nature, who stand as the dominant species on Earth. This dichotomy illustrates that simplicity has its virtues, but there are scenarios where embracing complexity is essential for solving intricate problems.\n\nLife's full of paradoxes, anon. These paradoxes make it seem like \"absolutes\" are never absolute. We're just surfing on a sea of endless grays, never really hitting black or white. The more you think you got it figured out, the more it slips right through your fingers. It's the ultimate mind-bender.\n\nAnyways, today I helped coach a wrestling match and it was awesome watching all the kids I work with (190 and up) go undefeated. It's cool being on the other side of sports. Coaching rather than competing. I feel privileged I get to help these young men grow.\n\n![2nd place at the Fernindina Beach high school tourney](https://miro.medium.com/1*IvXZGVQww-E_f6UQWu0VTg.png)\n\nGod is good!\n\n12/9/23\n\nConor jay Chepenik",
