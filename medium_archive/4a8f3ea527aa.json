I've been on a reading kick lately and my perspective has changed tremendously. Reading about things I never imagined possible inspires me to be more productive. The [story ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku1vdrWQuJY)of Sir Roger Bannister breaking the 4-minute mile is incredible. Many thought it was an impossible task until someone proved it could be done. Seeing Roger Bannister run a sub-4-minute mile and almost collapse as he crossed the finish line brought tears to my eye. What a special thing to accomplish and shortly after a whole bunch of other runners broke sub-4-minutes. Think about that for a second. All it took for a bunch of runners to do the impossible was to learn someone else had done it.\n\nToday I went to the park to throw the football, hit baseballs, and play basketball with friends in Medford. While my buddies and I were playing baseball a little kid and his father stood in the bleachers nearby. The little kid started geeking and yelling WOOOOOOOWWWW every time someone hit the baseball far. Soon all of us were smiling and enjoying some outdoor time. The little kid had such a contagious laugh, it reminded me how powerful positivity can be. There is extraordinary stuff in our normal interactions. Most people are too caught up worrying about things they can't control. Life is full of awesome moments if you take the time to notice.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*lvdsL3wA014w5H1w)\n\n3/27/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik\n\nP.S bitcoin is going to win ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¯",
