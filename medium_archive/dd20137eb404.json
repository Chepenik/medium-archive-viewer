Imagine if Steve Jobs had witnessed Apple's tentative steps around Bitcoin. One can almost see him, a mixture of anger and excitement, at the prospect of integrating this pioneering digital currency into Apple, upset that it hasn't already been done. Jobs, the mastermind who transformed the unconventional into the iconic, would likely have been mesmerized by the disruptive nature of Bitcoin. Renowned for his electrifying presentations, he might have embraced Bitcoin with the same zeal he had for every 'one more thing.'\n\n**Apple's Legacy: A Vision Of Innovation**\n\nJobs legacy, defined by bold leaps from the sleek iMacs to the intuitive iPhones, suggests that Jobs understood the power of thinking differently. Both Steve and Satoshi offered the world more than a hypothetical tech romance. They gifted the world technology that changed the course of history for the better. Apple, born from the ethos of 'thinking different,' emerged as the maverick of the tech world. Today, Bitcoin mirrors this rebellious spirit in the realm of finance, challenging and reshaping our fundamental understanding of value. Bitcoin represents a shift in the global financial paradigm, much like Apple did in technology. For Apple to embrace Bitcoin would be more than a strategic move; it would be a nod to its roots, a marriage of Apple's trailblazing ingenuity with the untamed frontier of truly scarce money. This union could mark yet another chapter in Apple's legacy of defying the norm and charting a course toward the future.\n\n**Bitcoin and Apple: The Power Duo Tech Needs**\n\nApple's history of bold moves - think iPod, iPhone, and iPad - reads like a guidebook for tech revolutionaries. Now, imagine adding 'Bitcoin integration' to this illustrious list. Bitcoin, much like Apple, started as an outsider, a digital David in a world of financial Goliaths. The synergy is almost poetic; Apple revolutionized personal tech, while Bitcoin reimagined personal finance. Marrying Apple's user-centric design with Bitcoin's decentralized ethos could redefine financial interaction. Who wouldn't want secure, seamless Bitcoin transactions through Apple Pay? Android users maybe? Everyone except the banks would love having no more middlemen nibbling away at your funds. This could be Apple's next 'one more thing,' a visionary step that would have Steve Jobs grinning with pride, witnessing his legacy continue to shape the future.\n\n**Confronting Crypto Fears with a Dash of Apple Magic**\n\nLet's face it though, Bitcoin can feel like a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma to many. But the internet was once a puzzle too. If you interviewed people on the street how many do you think could tell you what TCP/IP stands for? Probably a lot less than the number of people who know how to do a google search. That's why great companys build tech that just works.\n\nApple has a history of demystifying complex tech - remember how the iPod simplified music? Apple could transform Bitcoin from a quickly growing niche curiosity to an everyday utility. Picture 'iBitcoin' - an intuitive, sleek platform where handling Bitcoin is as straightforward and secure as sending an iMessage. Designed with such elegance that even grandparents could effortlessly navigate buying, selling, and transferring sats. Tim Cook has the opportunity to channel Jobs' legacy, converting what seems daunting into something delightfully user-friendly. In Apple's realm, intimidating tech doesn't stand a chance against the power of creative simplicity.\n\n**A Dream Come True: Apple Pay Meets Bitcoin**\n\nNow, let's dream a bit. Picture paying for your next MacBook with Bitcoin via Apple Pay. Sounds like science fiction? Not in a world where Apple embraces Bitcoin. Apple has the power to make transferring money more simple and casual than posting a photo on social media. This would help small businesses thrive, unshackled from oppressive transaction fees and control tactics applied by legacy financial institutions. It would also give artists a chance to directly receive micro-contributions from their admirers. This revolution is not a mere fantasy - platforms and protocols like Nostr and Wavlake are already pioneering this reality, utilizing the Bitcoin/Lightning Network as the protocols to do so. Imagining Apple and Bitcoin in a symbiotic relationship, cultivating an ecosystem that transcends mere financial transactions and fosters the realization of aspirations is not such a far fetched dream. Steve Jobs once advised to 'Stay hungry, stay foolish.' What could embody that hunger and audacity more than Apple spearheading the integration of Bitcoin, bringing financial liberty to the masses, including those less technically inclined or newly awakening to the allure of Bitcoin's freedom?\n\n**Conclusion: A Call to Action for Apple's Next Big Step**\n\nApple embracing Bitcoin is just the kind of visionary move Steve Jobs would have admired. It's time for Apple to once again redefine the future, not just by creating the next big gadget, but by revolutionizing how we interact with money itself. Over to you, Tim Cook.\n\n1/29/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
