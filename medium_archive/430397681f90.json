The comfort of being back home is wonderful, yet I find myself missing the tranquil pace of mountain life already. Those ten days vanished in an instant, leaving me with a profound appreciation for the rural lifestyle. It's quite different from my usual Florida experience.\n\nWhile southern hospitality is a hallmark of where I live, I couldn't help but notice the slower, more personal interactions in Montana. In smaller towns, people seem to crave connection, perhaps because new faces are less common. This stark contrast to city life left a lasting impression.\n\nFlying with Sloan, our 1.5-year-old daughter, was not so fun. Her growing energy and dislike for sitting still led us to reluctantly hand over the iPad during parts of the flight. It's astonishing how quickly young children grasp these devices, and while Sloan's aptitude impresses me, I'm acutely aware of the delicate balance between screen time and a normal childhood.\n\nTechnology is a double edged sword. My recent travels highlighted both the wonders and concerns of our digital age. While captivating podcasts made my flights more enjoyable, one particular episode raised alarms about the impact of our increasingly digital world on children's well-being. Many social media platforms seem designed to maximize engagement, essentially priming our brains with dopamine hits.\n\nThis realization leaves me pondering: How can we counteract the pull of these addictive apps and maintain a healthy balance between technology and childhood? The answer likely lies in:\n\n1. Setting clear boundaries\n2. Limiting screen time\n3. Encouraging physical activities\n4. Fostering real-life connections\n\nBy implementing these strategies, I believe we can help our children develop emotional intelligence and maintain equilibrium in an ever-evolving digital landscape. As I reflect on my own childhood, I remember wishing for honesty about drugs rather than simple demonization. The same principle applies to technology: it can bring short-term pleasure but may have long-term consequences. There's a price for everything, whether it's food, exercise, or screen time. Honesty is always the best policy. Of course, the truth can hurt sometimes, but in the long run, it will leave you profoundly better off than telling lies.\n\nI believe that being honest with Sloan about the benefits and drawbacks of technology will be crucial in helping her find the right balance. By acknowledging that these technologies are here to stay and discussing their impacts openly, we can equip our children with the tools to navigate the digital world responsibly.\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into this topic, I recommend listening to the podcast that sparked these reflections. It raises important questions about our relationship with technology and its impact on the next generation.\n\n![[https://youtu.be/-l2TdinWoM8](https://youtu.be/-l2TdinWoM8)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ToGutFdYHCuIRItpo6nR2Q.png)\n\n7/18/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
