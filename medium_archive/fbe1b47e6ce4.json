  "content": "# Day 1025\n\nToday, I tried making ice cream with my brand-new ice cream maker (thank you, Santa). Things were going great until I paused it to toss in some extra ingredients. That's when disaster struck. The machine refused to start back up, like it suddenly remembered it wasn't paid overtime. Turns out, the cream had frozen so solid that the poor motor didn't stand a chance. It just sat there, whimpering.\n\nLesson learned. Funny enough, it's a perfect metaphor for life. If you take the time to prepare and actually learn how to do something, things go smoothly. But try to cut corners, and suddenly you're stuck, wasting ten times more effort trying to fix the mess you made. Do the extra work upfront. Your future self will send you a thank-you card.\n\nWho knew ice cream could teach life lessons? I thought it was just supposed to taste good.\n\n![I wish my ice cream had turned out like this lol.](https://miro.medium.com/0*LmZQZEMrY4Wen9ev)\n\n1/10/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
