I did a 7 day fast earlier this year and the whole time I was having serious cravings for a green monster milkshake & a patty melt from Tasty Burger. This time my cravings were less intense but I am eager to enjoy some gold rush chicken tenders from Hurricanes at some point after I break my fast properly. Can't break my fast with foods that I know are unhealthy. I'm thinking watermelon to break my fast tomorrow.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1728955855448723636%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nIf it were not for this post I would have broken my fast early. I did drink some bone broth Tuesday and Wednesday but could not bring myself to drink anymore during the final two days because the taste does not sound appetizing after it being the only thing with calories I consumed.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1730617353568698844%3Fs%3D20&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nHow you leverage social media is important. Super easy to just consume mindlessly. I still do many times but I'm working on it. However, using it as a tool to better myself has proved very valuable. Social pressure can be both a serious force for bad and an incredible tool for good.\n\nAt the moment my 2024 New Years Resolutions are:\n\n- Keep writing every day.\n\n- Continue to run 40 miles every month.\n\n- Do a 3 day fast every month.\n\nThis might change but whatever I decide on I will tweet about to hold myself accountable.\n\n12/1/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
