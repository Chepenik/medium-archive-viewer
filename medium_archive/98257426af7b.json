  "content": "# Day 693\n\n\"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received - hatred. The great creators - the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors - stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won.\" - Ayn Rand in her book The Fountainhead\n\nHuman innovation has consistently challenged the status quo, creating essentials we can't imagine living without. Consider a world void of airplanes, leading to extensive delays in receiving packages, or experiencing dental procedures without anesthesia, reminiscent of horror movie scenes.\n\nThe Wright brothers, inspired by birds, persevered through skepticism and failures to invent the airplane, transforming global travel and complaints about airline food. Similarly, the introduction of the motor car revolutionized transportation, moving beyond horse-drawn carriages to autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe invention of TCP/IP turned the globe into a vast network, enabling the sharing of memes, endless cat videos, and debates over pizza toppings. Meanwhile, GDP became a metric to gauge economic success, though it captures only a fraction of life's pleasures, like the love you receive from your family and close friends.\n\nOur world is vastly improved by those who dared to embrace the impossible. Innovators, from the past and present, have enabled us to traverse oceans, alleviate pain, and share moments instantly across continents. Here's to the inventors and creators who've crafted a world filled with wonder, connectivity, and new value that others didn't think was possible.\n\n2/13/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
