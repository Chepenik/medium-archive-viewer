  "content": "# Day 549\n\nV8 enthusiasts say, 'You drive a V6? I could never.' V6 enthusiasts might respond, 'You're rolling with a 4-cylinder? Turbocharged or not, I could never.' Turbocharged V4 fans might jest, 'You're on a Vespa? I could never.' Vespa enthusiasts might inquire, 'You ride a bicycle? I could never.' Cyclists might comment, 'You walk? I could never.' The walkers just laugh and say, 'You stress about gym fees, gas bills, car payments, insurance, tickets and vehicle maintenance? Lmao I have not been to the gym in years, I get sunlight everyday, and my morning walk is the highlight of my day' a happy life is all about perspective🛻🚗🛵🚴 ‍♂️🚶 ‍♂️\n\nI posted this on Nostr as a random shitpost that just popped in my head. Honestly though I think it holds some value. So many things are a matter of perspective. One of my all time favorite sayings is there are three truths. What each person experienced and what actually happened. So if a situation has more then 3 people then maybe there are more than 3 truths but you get the idea. Navigating between the subjective and the objective is a tall order for most because emotions get the best of humans 99.99% of the time🥲😂\n\n![[https://x.com/oldbooksguy/status/1705224041135780314?s=20](https://x.com/oldbooksguy/status/1705224041135780314?s=20)](https://miro.medium.com/1*_cHsks3LeXyCoO_8osUr4g.png)\n\nYesterday, I had the privilege of attending a [MassAdoption](http://massadoption.net) Bitcoin meetup where I heard a captivating talk by a man named Steve. One part of his speech has lingered in my thoughts ever since. Steve spoke about his frequent visits to Haiti before the pandemic hit. He mentioned he has been unable to visit since the pandemic, so he started sending money to the children he cherished in Haiti from time to time.\n\nSteve highlighted the exorbitant fees charged by Western Union for sending money, but that wasn't the most significant issue. He revealed that Haiti is essentially a failed state overrun by gangs, making it impossible for the child he supports to collect the money from Western Union. Gang members lie in wait outside and rob people as they leave.\n\nI often quip, 'Bitcoin fixes this,' but in this instance, Bitcoin can genuinely save lives. Privacy is a critical, often overlooked aspect that is sacrificed for convenience. It's a harsh reality, but it's the truth. While Bitcoin doesn't provide flawless privacy, it eliminates the need for physically visiting a location to access your money. Steve's story opened my eyes to the paramount importance of privacy and also reminded me I'm incredibly privileged. I know almost nothing about Haiti but that story makes me realize I'm lucky to have all the luxuries I have in my life.\n\nI live in a rich country, which allows me to ponder the importance of privacy and perspective. If I didn't know where my next meal was coming from, I couldn't afford to be a \"think boi\" and write on Medium every day. I would be in survival mode.\n\nThat said, perspective can help us to be more compassionate. When we can see things from other people's perspectives, we're more likely to understand their motivations and empathize with their experiences.\n\nI'm not sure what rat study Josh is referring to in the picture above, but I agree with the idea. It's the same theme as the classic \"weak men > hard times, hard times > strong men, strong men > good times, good times > weak men\" cycle. Why take any risks if you have bread and circuses whenever you want?\n\nNo matter what part of the cycle you're facing, take some time to be grateful. When you think about how there are people afraid to go to Western Union because they will be robbed, it makes you step back and realize how damn good you have it. At least it made me think that.\n\n9/22/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
