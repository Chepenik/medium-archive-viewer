What strikes me is how despite being penned over five decades ago Rand's insights remain remarkably prescient today.\n\nIn her book, Rand draws a vivid line between Romanticism and Naturalism. This distinction doesn't just shed light on Rand's own literary approach but also offers a valuable framework for analyzing and crafting literature.\n\nRand was a staunch proponent of Romanticism, which she saw as an artistic expression that underscores the significance of volition in our lives. For her, Romantic art was about portraying life not just as it is, but as it could and should be - a perfect marriage with her philosophical ethos, Objectivism. This school of thought emphasizes reason, individualism, and the pursuit of personal happiness. Romantic literature, from Rand's perspective, is a celebration of human potential, achievement, and our heroic nature.\n\nIn stark contrast, Rand perceived Naturalism as a movement entrenched in determinism - the notion that our environment and genetics inexorably shape us, leaving scant room for personal destiny. Naturalistic literature often dwells on life's more mundane or somber facets. Rand criticized this as a pessimistic, passive view of humanity, undercutting the importance of individual choice and our capacity for greatness.\n\nGrasping these differences is enlightening for writers and readers alike. As a writer, understanding if your work leans more towards the Romantic or Naturalistic ethos can deepen your grasp of your themes and characters. Are you highlighting the power of individual choice and idealism (Romanticism), or focusing on environmental influence and a deterministic outlook (Naturalism)?\n\nI find myself in agreement with Rand's assertion of our volitional nature. The notion that we're incapable of altering our circumstances seems more like a convenient excuse than a reality. That is what the enemy wants: a passive populace. Screw them, listen to Rand and embrace romanticism.\n\nWould be fascinating to see what Rand thought of chatGPT. On the one hand I suspect she would find it rather impressive and a great way to help creative people. On the other hand I think she would find it is way too much of a crutch for many rather than a tool to enhance their abilities. It often seems like everything can be a double edged sword.\n\n12/4/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
