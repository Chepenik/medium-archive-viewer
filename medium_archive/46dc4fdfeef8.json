The idea is to answer 1,000 questions on a voice recorder, and then you could train an AI on those responses as well as pass down the data to your family. What a cool concept. I'll attempt to answer question 1 on their list for tonight's Medium post:\n\n_What is your most treasured childhood memory?_\n\nMan, that question sent me down a rabbit hole of so many different memories from my past. It's hard to say what exactly counts as childhood, but for the sake of the question, I'll assume it means 0–18 years old. One of my most treasured moments, the one I'm most proud of during my adolescence, was winning the district championship in wrestling my junior year.\n\nIt was such a meaningful moment because I wasn't sure if I could do it. It was my second year wrestling, and the two kids I was up against were older and had beaten me the year before. My wrestling coach also died that year from an overdose, and he was an amazing person. He was a seriously talented man who wrestled in the olympics and at some point in his career he had suffered a brutal injury. As a result of this he was put on pain pills, which would prove fatal later on. So sad to see something like that happen to one of the best wrestlers and wrestling coaches I've ever worked with. I must say, shout out to Gio for stepping up and assuming that coaching role after Brad passed, but man, it was tough losing Brad in the first place.\n\nAnyway, I'll never forget winning the semifinals against a wrestler named Max and then the finals against David. The finals went into overtime, and when David shot, I was able to sprawl and get around him. I was so exhausted, so tired, but I just kept pushing. After winning, my dad held me and I cried into his arms. The immense joy I felt was incredible after that match. I whispered in my dad's ear that this one was for Brad, and it was. I know he was looking down from heaven, so proud of me. I think we got sushi or Thai food afterwards. I honestly don't remember what we ate, but man, that was an incredible moment.\n\n![Right after winning the match](https://miro.medium.com/0*C0_pup7Sphkqt63P)\n\n![W](https://miro.medium.com/0*HjnFUTYDEhsInk59)\n\n![W from the front!](https://miro.medium.com/0*KnVCezLNyX3Cd-ij)\n\nThere are plenty of other great moments from childhood. I was blessed with a loving family and don't recall missing a meal due to poverty or anything like that. My childhood was by no means perfect, but it was a really good one, and looking back now as an adult, it's clear I had and have so much to be grateful for.\n\nThis whole exercise of digging through memories is fascinating, it's incredible how much we forget until something prompts us to remember. The SaveWisdom project is brilliant in that way; it forces you to excavate experiences that have shaped you but might otherwise remain buried. What an amazing gift this could be for future generations, having access to these personal stories, perspectives, and lessons learned.\n\nCase in point: I just remembered one of the most terrifying experiences from my childhood was watching _Beowulf_. Watching it now, it's pretty gory and has some scary scenes, but I'm so desensitized that it's not that bad. But man, as a 10-year-old, I was losing it in the theater. I literally made my family leave. These are the kinds of vivid, formative moments that resurface when you really dig deep, the exact type of memories that make this project so valuable.\n\nAs Brian, the project's creator says, \"Deep gratitude\".\n\n8/17/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
