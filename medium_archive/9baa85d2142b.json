Grateful I got to see Yellowstone which was stunning. Grateful that the soon to be 47th President of The United States is still alive and America avoided what would have likely been a civil war. God is good man. üôè\n\n![A big ass Buffalo booling by the side of the rode](https://miro.medium.com/1*n6OU4n9gToqCbrkwFgX4Mg.png)\n\n![A place we hiked](https://miro.medium.com/1*7dKxzaPjy2S20X4emJ2rTQ.png)\n\n![Ol' faithful!](https://miro.medium.com/1*hkg9GKcxG0FuhNyiQ3kNuQ.png)\n\n![A pretty spot near where I popped the question](https://miro.medium.com/1*C_fGALFHNq04aQn--PUxcA.png)\n\n![A bird's nest we saw inside Yellowstone](https://miro.medium.com/1*DBcZBqSk6FY36jDXIF42eA.png)\n\n![A Photo I took early in the morning on our drive out to Yellowstone national park](https://miro.medium.com/1*zwjgqoWCqcVHlUpiKhLDQg.png)\n\nHope you enjoyed the photo dump anon üòÄ\n\n7/14/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
