  "content": "# Day 710\n\nWatched Dune today at Sun-ray Cinema. It was an awesome film. There were some fight scenes that were a little sus but overall the score of the movie was fantastic and the acting was well done. Would recommend. It makes me want to read the books.\n\nI'm almost finished with the Fountainhead and I sort of spoiled the ending by watching the movie before I finished the book. However, I have loved seeing what happens. It's fascinating to observe the distinctions between a novel and its cinematic adaptation. I often find that books offer a richer experience, granting the unique pleasure of conjuring the characters in one's own mind. Conversely, movies provide a welcomed opportunity to unwind and engage the mind in a more passive manner. It's nice to just watch a \"tell-a-vision\" or, in my case tonight, watching the movie on the big screen rather than the medium screen at home.\n\nStory telling is so powerful. People can literally make stuff up with their minds and if the story is enthralling others will consume and adore your made up fantasies. Kind of wild to think about it like that, but it's essentially what happens.\n\nHere is to the story tellers, the creators, the individuals not afraid to put themselves out there and make great stuff.\n\n![Walmart version Dune hahahaha](https://miro.medium.com/0*xLohGIPM7mLoPQRK)\n\n3/1/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
