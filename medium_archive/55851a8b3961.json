But for now, my mission is closer to the ground. I need to focus on becoming an author and writing my first book. I've got a backyard to fix up, Christmas gifts to buy (and 3D print), and articles to write.\n\nBut you know what's more important than all of that? Above everything else, I need to remember this: the best way to help the world is to look inward. To recognize that I'm answering to a higher power - one that wants me to uncover my life's mission. Finding that purpose is how I can truly benefit the world. Because the truth is, fixing the world starts with fixing yourself.\n\nIt takes humility to listen to your soul, to truly take the time to discover your purpose. But when you do, happiness follows. Gratitude helps, too. And while there are many things I \"need\" to do, I know I have time, and I trust they will get done. I'm confident in that.\n\n12/10/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
