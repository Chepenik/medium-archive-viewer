Regardless of your relationship status, tuning in is a valuable investment. While I'm making a general observation, a significant insight I gained is that men often engage in \"mansplaining\" from a place of genuine concern. It's driven by our desire to share our knowledge with those we hold in high regard.\n\nConversely, women often seek connection through conversation. They yearn for the opportunity to express themselves and have their thoughts heard. Sometimes, it's not about finding solutions but about creating a bond. Take the example of discussing what someone had for lunch - there's no practical solution to that. In those instances, a woman simply wishes for her partner to lend an empathetic ear.\n\nAs a man in a relationship, recognizing these nuances can be transformative. A small but impactful step is to communicate openly by asking, \"Are you seeking advice, or do you simply want me to be a listening ear?\" This simple gesture can go a long way in fostering understanding and connection between partners.\n\nNow, gentlemen, I get it - comprehending your partner's office nemesis or the intricacies of her tuna salad might not seem as riveting as today's sports ball game. But believe me, the path of wisdom is paved with attentive listening. So, grab your popcorn, buckle up, and treat Jennifer's team takeout saga like the most captivating tale in the universe.\n\nAnd to the ladies, when your man transforms into an accidental professor, don't jump to the conclusion that he's delivering a lecture because he doubts your brilliance. No! He is actually unveiling his love in those moments. Investing in the art of refining your relationships is a high-yield activity. Let us be wise investors in love & connection because the dividends will pay off for the rest of your life.\n\n![My partner and I after AI style transfer with heart themes did us real dirtyðŸ˜‚ ](https://miro.medium.com/0*0xko83AjR9RE7RA8)\n\n8/31/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
