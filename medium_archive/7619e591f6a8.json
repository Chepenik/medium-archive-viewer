It's absolutely mind-boggling how people just conquered new lands. Lewis & Clark must have been some bad mfs if the stories I learned about as a kid are true. No wonder so many explorers met their maker while exploring. Many times on the journey up I couldn't help but think of the [Nature Is Metal](https://www.instagram.com/natureismetal/?hl=en) account.\n\nThat said, super glad I did the hike, it was just much harder than I anticipated. Also very grateful my stepdad gave me a gun to carry because God forbid had a bear shown up and I had been unarmed. It was reassuring knowing I could defend myself. I'm usually one to listen to pods when walking, running, exercising, but not on this hike. The whole time I was listening for wild animals.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1810808895818060046](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1810808895818060046)](https://miro.medium.com/1*sWurlOUEwd7HE44fB5lKFA.png)\n\nAnway's, it's a peaceful life out here, one I can get used to. An added bonus is how nice it is not spending money because there are no stores close by. Looking forward to more Montana days.\n\n7/9/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
