The Vietnam War serves as a poignant illustration of this. Despite the superior weaponry of the French and later the United States, the Vietnamese demonstrated unmatched resilience and strategic prowess. Their adoption of guerrilla warfare tactics not only revolutionized combat but also enabled them to outmaneuver and eventually overcome far more powerful adversaries. It also helped that the Vietnamese had a much greater cause to fight for. I know I would fight much harder to protect my home than I would fighting for somebody else's home.\n\nThis dynamic finds a parallel in the world of filmmaking. Many of cinema's most compelling works were created during technological infancy, suggesting limitation can spur creativity. Without today's digital editing tricks, directors had to innovate within their humble means. This necessity often bred an authentic, raw vision that still grips audiences. Constraint is not just an obstacle, but a pathway to inventiveness. Both war and art demonstrate that victory and brilliance stem not from might or tools alone, but rather from fully utilizing the resources and strengths that are available.\n\nNecessity is a powerful motivator. For example, through poverty we often discover the richness of abundance. By embracing abstinence, we can unearth deeper meanings. Shedding the burdens that anchor us, we embrace versatility and lightness of being. The more I delve into life's mysteries, the more I'm astonished by its inherent paradoxes.\n\nWhile ironic, these ideas do make sense when you think about it from first principles. Our focus and energy are finite resources. When scattered across too many pursuits, effectiveness dwindles; nothing substantial is achieved.\n\nReflecting on my own journey, I realize the importance of pinpointing and nurturing my true passions. The proverbial 'jack of all trades' seldom achieves remarkable success. Fortunately, we live in an era where capitalism's encouragement of labor specialization has created unprecedented abundance. In such a world, the merits of specialization are what allow someone to find immense success. So find what you love, think deeply about the resources you have available, then put yourself in a position where you must succeed.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*t8Rfb0iVYihvQwdhSR-c5A.png)\n\n12/30/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
