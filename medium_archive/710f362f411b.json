  "content": "# Day 806\n\nTonight was date night with my life partner, my lil Mama, the love of my life. It was absolutely amazing! I'm so grateful to be back home where my Dad can watch our child, giving me the chance to spend some quality time with the Misses. We had pizza then we went to a local brewery.\n\nI'm going to host a Bitcoin meetup at this brewery. It's a fantastic spot.\n\n![[https://primal.net/e/note1mcdfrwq4s5qpxljdyvyzlud93vydf08ymyspck4mzkwm8zaht8dqaxrcaa](https://primal.net/e/note1mcdfrwq4s5qpxljdyvyzlud93vydf08ymyspck4mzkwm8zaht8dqaxrcaa)](https://miro.medium.com/1*YWsUEt36YAFf-Hz_V86kNg.png)\n\nFuture looks bright. Don't let others tell you otherwise!\n\n6/5/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
