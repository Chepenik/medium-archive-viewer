  "content": "# Day 774\n\nToday I drove to Connecticut and back from New Jersey to attend the [MassAdoption](http://massadoption.net) Freedom Festival. Twas' amazing seeing all my boys from Boston.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1786937746738589713&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI also got to say that Parkour is a workout and super fun. Not something I had ever done\n\nLot's of value in being able to move your body efficiently and learning how to jump over stuff. Grassroots movements leading the way to Mass Adoption.\n\nIt's amazing getting to talk with Bitcoiners who see and want to fix the problems caused by broken money. The spirit of human ingenuity and our ability to innovate is not something I would personally bet against. Bullish on humanity.\n\nNow I'm going to watch some Netflix because I've been driving and networking all day. May the 4th be with you!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1786814617634709663&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n5/4/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
