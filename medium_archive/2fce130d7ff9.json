  "content": "# Day 778\n\nRule #1 politicians aren't going to save you and everything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. They're after your vote, which means they'll say what they think you want to hear. However, breaking campaign promises isn't a cakewalk, especially when many people expect them to deliver.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1788368193238847881&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI'm with the Orangeman in terms of keeping cryptocurrency innovation in the United States. No need for the empire to crumble because it goes full tyrant and crushes the industry. I genuinely believe Bitcoin is the signal and everything else is noise. Stable coins might be scaffolding for hyperbitcoinization, time will tell. Whatever happens I would prefer to see the U.S. stay ahead in this race.\n\nIt is in the best interest of the United States to maintain a competitive edge in this emerging field. By fostering an environment conducive to cryptocurrency development and adoption, we can attract talent, investment, and wealth creation within our borders. While I support the global success of this technology, as an American, I would like to see our nation lead the way in driving innovation in this space.\n\nAnyways, it is going to be wild watching the 2024 election play out. The rapidness with which news and information now spread is remarkable. In the year 2000, the idea that by 2024 we would all carry HD cameras capable of instantly sharing video globally would have seemed farcical. Yet, here we are. This makes me ponder what groundbreaking developments the world might witness by 2048. While the specifics are uncertain, I know the landscape will look strikingly different.\n\nBullish on freedom technologies to make sure humanity is on the right path because the incentives are so good. Politicians won't save us, but freedom tech just might.\n\n![[https://primal.net/e/note1uhn944re2g7xuatw78e0l9k4mknsedwn6qstjrqcu8qcxu7q3wfqdpk43j](https://primal.net/e/note1uhn944re2g7xuatw78e0l9k4mknsedwn6qstjrqcu8qcxu7q3wfqdpk43j)](https://miro.medium.com/1*Z47-S_uekoYIP25Cc1eZuQ.png)\n\n![AI enhancement](https://miro.medium.com/1*o3SJcq4UZp6AGp5xBVlOzw.jpeg)\n\nThe potential of micropayments and decentralized payment systems should not be overlooked. The ability to seamlessly transfer small amounts of value could unlock new economic models and incentive structures. Imagine a future where individuals are compensated for their attention and engagement through micropayments facilitated by email or other digital platforms. This could pave the way for the emergence of micro-economies, where value is exchanged in a more granular and decentralized manner. Such systems have the potential to reshape how we perceive and participate in economic activities, creating new opportunities for individuals and businesses alike. While the concept may seem novel, the widespread adoption of micropayments could revolutionize various industries and redefine our understanding of value exchange. Bullish on the ability for humans to create new and innovative networking solutions with the VoIP protocol that is Bitcoin.\n\n![Merica Fuck Yea](https://miro.medium.com/0*WJsGZlAJi80djXeV)\n\n![[https://x.com/stijnnoorman/status/1787833267669856667](https://x.com/stijnnoorman/status/1787833267669856667)](https://miro.medium.com/1*sieY3ou8xQJuN62LUVF7Og.png)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1788375226570690905&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n5/8/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
