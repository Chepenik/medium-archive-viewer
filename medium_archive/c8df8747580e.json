  "content": "# Day 1135\n\n**Should You Have Children?**\n\nHard yes.\n\nThe world will give you a thousand reasons to wait.\nBuild your career. Stack more cash. Travel. Sleep in. \"Find yourself.\"\n\nThat's all fine advice until it gets twisted into _don't have kids because they'll ruin all that_.\nAnd that's where the lie creeps in.\n\nBut you?\nA creature made in the image of The Lord!\nYou were not made to consume until you die.\nYou were made to _create_.\n\nLet me ask you something:\nWhen you're on your deathbed, who do you want in the room?\nA pile of pay stubs? A few \"super fans\"? Your favorite podcast host?\n\nOf course not. \nYou want it to be the people who carry your face in theirs.\nYour blood. Your fire. Your name.\n\nAnd yeah having kids is hard.\nIt will challenge you in ways you did not imagine.\nBut if it doesn't challenge you, then it wasn't worth doing.\n\nSo ask yourself this and be honest with the answer:\nDo you want people who will hold your hand when you're fading,\n and remember how you lived when you're gone?\n\nBecause if that's the end you want, start building it now.\nDon't wait for the \"perfect time.\"\nIt never shows up.\n\nNone of your ancestors died a virgin.\nAnd you shouldn't either.\n\nFind someone you love.\nAnd bring life into the world.\n\nIt will break you open in the best way.\n\nAnd it will give more meaning to your life\nthan anything you'll ever buy, build, or binge.\n\nNo one regrets the love they gave.\nOnly the time they didn't.\n\n![[https://x.com/Cernovich/status/1917711212483338721](https://x.com/Cernovich/status/1917711212483338721)](https://miro.medium.com/1*tYCk0Y25sMLf8s1Mk6Wfkw.png)\n\n4/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
