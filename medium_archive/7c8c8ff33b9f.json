  "content": "# Day 421\n\nAh I must say I'm feeling proud of myself. I got the giphy API working in my app Habit-Chain and it feels damn good. The code is open source and here is the repo.\n\n> [**GitHub - Chepenik/Habit-Chain**](https://github.com/Chepenik/Habit-Chain)\n\nI am also a few steps away from having my MassAdoption print magazine ready to be created. Super excited to see this bad boy printed and go from a canva PDF to a tangible magazine in my hands.\n\nLast night I laid out my sucks again and that led me to run this morning. 2/2 when I lay out my socks and 0/1 when I don't. Moral of the story is if you want to run then lower the barriers to putting on your shoes and have your socks serve as a reminder.

Specifically these two.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-w-aYVXcOk4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-w-aYVXcOk4&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-w-aYVXcOk4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FcOS8dqBuZe4%3Fstart%3D1806%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D1806&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcOS8dqBuZe4&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FcOS8dqBuZe4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nI will say I spent too much time staring at a computer screen. My eyes feel drained and bloodshot. So that's about all I'm going to write today but guess what.\n\n1 short medium and 3 (albeit big) commits on github later and my streaks are still alive. I keep showing up. LFGðŸ¤™ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜¤ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ˆ\n\n5/17/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
