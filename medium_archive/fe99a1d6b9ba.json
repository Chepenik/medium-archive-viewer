  "content": "# Day 1141\n\n![a photo I made this morning](https://miro.medium.com/0*TgkdDF9NeiS7o1_M)\n\nToday was kicked off with a workout, which felt great despite my restless night. I had the weirdest dreams. Bizarre doesn't even begin to describe them. I'm not saying my dinner combo of sushi and BBQ chicken wings was to blame, but my stomach certainly voiced its objections both last night and today. Sushi generally does not mix well with other things even though it's one of my favorite foods.\n\nThe first dream I had jolted me wide awake. I was at my childhood home, fleeing from an aggressive dog when suddenly the owner pulled a gun on me just as I made it inside. Heart racing, I woke up, only to fall back into another strange dream. This time, I found myself in Washington state near Seattle at a Bitcoin event with my college buddy Kuba and, oddly enough, the CEO of the company I work for. Though I've never actually visited Seattle, my subconscious seemed convinced that's where we were. The details get fuzzy, but somehow I wandered from the Bitcoin meetup to a church.\n\nAfter such fractured sleep, I felt groggy throughout the day. But the evening made up for it. After work and squeezing in some interviews for my Bitcoinnews.com side hustle, I enjoyed dinner with my daughter Sloan, my Pops, and my sister Stela. There's something deeply restorative about family time. When I tried to capture the moment with a photo, Sloan asserted her independence with a firm \"no cameras.\" She cracks me up\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*SUx7ozbsyssXkzvX)\n\n:)\n\n5/6/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
