It allows individuals to maintain control over their personal information, behaviors, and possessions, enabling them to form their own identities and make decisions about what they wish to reveal to others. Privacy creates a safe space for exploring ideas and beliefs without fear of judgment, encouraging creativity and the free exchange of information vital for personal growth and a democratic society. Crucially, privacy protects private property by preventing unwanted intrusions and misuse of one's belongings, data, and intellectual property, shielding against potential exploitation or financial loss.\n\nHowever, in our digital era, privacy has often taken a backseat as technological advancements have made it easier to collect, store, and share personal data. The rise of social media, online tracking, and data mining practices have eroded privacy in unprecedented ways. This trend is concerning because a lack of privacy can have severe consequences for individuals and society as a whole. Without adequate privacy protections, we risk losing our ability to think and express ourselves freely, maintain control over our personal information and assets, and ultimately, preserve our fundamental human rights and freedoms.\n\nLuckily, we have public/private key cryptography. Math and computer code offer humanity a great degree of financial privacy and autonomy in the digital realm. Thank God for Bitcoin.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1770554561561833947&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n4/24/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
