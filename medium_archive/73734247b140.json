  "content": "# Day 826\n\nThe world is evolving at an unprecedented pace, making it challenging to stay abreast of the latest developments. Drones have emerged as the cutting-edge weaponry of contemporary battlefields. The ability to mass-produce these advanced technologies provides a significant strategic advantage to any military force, positioning them at the forefront of modern warfare. It's honestly extremely terrifying and I hope I never have to experience this kind of warfare.\n\n![[https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1805370994527211661](https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1805370994527211661)](https://miro.medium.com/1*Kh6dPzpke7ycqOlgCOlj3A.png)\n\nIt reminds me a bit of a post I read on Nostr from **[Vitor Pamplona](https://primal.net/e/note1f0tyyc4tvghvxlm8zjmw7e5rul7kp54w4cfmav64sn3phuddyt8sdr3khw)** which I'll paraphrase: The current web landscape is heavily controlled by servers that have the power to alter or create content on your behalf without your knowledge. They handle everything from emails and medical records to social media posts, convincing us that we lack the necessary processing power, thus driving us to rely on complex server infrastructures. Despite modern phones having comparable processing capabilities to servers, we are led to believe that the current server-client architecture most apps are built on is indispensable. Furthermore, the concept of ownership in the digital realm is an illusion; everything from domain names to digital certificates is essentially rented. Data silos make it difficult to migrate, ensuring that users remain tethered to these services for a monthly fee.\n\nThank God for public/private key cryptography, where ownership and authenticity are actually granted. By owning your keys, you maintain complete control over your content & assets, ensuring that nothing can be altered or created without your consent. Every interaction, from likes to key presses, is signed, establishing a verifiable and unalterable record. Trust is shifted from intermediary servers to the original signers, ensuring data integrity. You have the power to determine how your data is managed and stored, constructing your digital history on your terms. Welcome to Nostr, where your digital presence is authentically yours. (I think the same idea applies to Bitcoin)\n\nThe times are-ah changing. You can resist change and experience a great deal of pain or you can adapt. I'm going to try and go with the latter because I know the coming years are going to be wild.\n\nBefore I close today's Medium out I'd like to note two things. One is I had a Bitcoin meetup at Aardwolf tonight which was really cool. I presented some slides which I enjoyed sharing. I'll paste the photos below of my slides, but without my presentation to go along, the slides won't do it justice.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*MNE8E99swF2U-lufL3KLbA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*qUdPsjhV713n70KrX777FQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*5ojE9I7qmuPjqftgOhMG4Q.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*s9k9NrJI8zbTL6jcSrrtAA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*RWo5o6JYtjhAjvYpcbAtmA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*qJnlb5mQ1HcX0VVj3fyd5g.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*AUZsksgDFrdvWLYSwhz4FA.png)\n\nFinally, I'll note these podcasts have blown my mind recently:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwnynozKz7Aw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwnynozKz7Aw&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FwnynozKz7Aw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fg197xdRZsW0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dg197xdRZsW0&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fg197xdRZsW0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fe5V1AlUd3Hc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3De5V1AlUd3Hc&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fe5V1AlUd3Hc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1zb2SuW-jug%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1zb2SuW-jug&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1zb2SuW-jug%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\n6/25/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
