  "content": "# Day 1116\n\nI found out that you can turn photos into statues with your 3D printer and I've been having so much fun. Here is the website I use to do so [https://makerworld.com/en/makerlab?from=navbar](https://makerworld.com/en/makerlab?from=navbar)\n\n![First I used this photo I made with AI](https://miro.medium.com/1*PeYCdCRikW8z8qak-xxdJA.png)\n\n![Then I printed this](https://miro.medium.com/1*DHB7kSxygKfvpUnql0E4Ow.png)\n\nTo be fair it probably would've been better to make the print a little bigger. However, how amazing is this?! You can use AI to generate a photo of anything then 3D print it. Man it's blowing my mind. I really need to get a Shopify store open asap.\n\nNow look I'm as bullish on AI as most tech people, but I also think it's important to realize what these machines can do. This post was pretty profound in my opinion.\n\n![[https://x.com/signulll/status/1910699595530752172](https://x.com/signulll/status/1910699595530752172)](https://miro.medium.com/1*eamyLpn-zJWH7QkGXPr7WA.png)\n\nWhat's amazing is Jack tweeted out the following today and I think it ties in with the above post. Who should own all that data about us? A company or ourselves?\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1910871501718323570](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1910871501718323570)](https://miro.medium.com/1*mbEnbs_sPcXwkb_zgJ78nw.png)\n\nI would argue the latter, but to be fair I don't have enough GPUs. The future is exciting just be mindful of the tools you use. It only accelerates from here.\n\n4/11/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
