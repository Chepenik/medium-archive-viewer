  "content": "# Day 647\n\nToday I attended a funeral at a beautiful church in Morristown New Jersey. It was a beautiful ceremony celebrating the life of my Partner's Grandmother.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*fNqvWjQt8BuXkr-G)\n\nThis picture does not do the beauty of the church justice. With the sunlight shining through the stain glass it is really a site to behold in person.\n\nAs a matter of fact my girl asked that we start going to church. She is right. Going to church is a good thing and I felt very good inside the holy place. I will make an effort to start going to church again.\n\nAfter the ceremony we went back to the home of my Partner's family and celebrated with food and alcohol. I played chess, ate way too many chocolate pretzels & Chinese food and drank an ungodly amount of beers.\n\nNot the healthiest day but it was a great day. Funerals are sad but celebrating with loved ones is always nice. God is good. Grateful for my health and the amazing people in my family.\n\n12/29/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
