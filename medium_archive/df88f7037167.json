  "content": "# Day 310\n\nToday has been a good day. Wasn't sure if I was going to get a run in but I decided to anyways and it was without a doubt the right call. First off the podcast I enjoyed on my run was solid. Big fan of these two individuals and the work they are doing to spread knowledge about freedom & Bitcoin. Important stuff nowadays.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed%2Fepisode%2F4MLPPrm6yE5yDK95nZQJ6F%3Futm_source%3Doembed&display_name=Spotify&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F4MLPPrm6yE5yDK95nZQJ6F&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2Fab67656300005f1f7153b9cc7ee2f468188dbad5&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=spotify\" title=\"\" height=\"152\" width=\"456\"></iframe>\n\nI'm in Jersey for the time being visiting my girl's family and around here the usual run I do is only two miles but up and down a steep mountain road. As I was getting ready to run up the longest uphill stretch I looked up and the sun was shining through the trees. It was such a beautiful scene I felt an instant mood boost. It made me think about how despite going through the adversity of running I'm so fortunate to be alive during this time. I can literally listen to two brilliant dudes shoot the shit while I'm nowhere near either person. It makes exercising a lot more enjoyable, no doubt about that.\n\nOther than that I spent a lot of time helping my buddy get ready to offer a paid subscription on his substack. That was a cool project and a bit of a challenge. Respect to him for putting in all that work. The kid is making the right moves and I look forward to reading his work.\n\nI'm going to spend some more time tomorrow working on that football piece but I'm pretty tired. Need to work on not spending so much time on my laptop but a lot of things I want to get done. Entering deep focus is a challenge with a newborn because the newborn is constantly needing something. GOOD! Life is no fun without challenges.\n\nLast thing I'll tag for today is a meme I came up with while watching my child feed plus a thread I wrote about energy usage.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1618750633808433153%3Fs%3D20%26t%3DpnBreI3o0JfIswQNi5C3XA&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/ConorChepenik/status/1618652411211706368%3Fs%3D20%26t%3DpnBreI3o0JfIswQNi5C3XA&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n1/26/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
