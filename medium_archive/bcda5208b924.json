  "content": "# Day 908\n\n![[https://x.com/DzambhalaHODL/status/1834959554859155879](https://x.com/DzambhalaHODL/status/1834959554859155879)](https://miro.medium.com/1*-Oh1qWnfEK5FDH8bfjK4JQ.png)\n\nI like Bitcoin yes I do. I like Bitcoin how about you?\n\n![[https://primal.net/e/note19ppgggdrlnytqt9ldjp0tj7482269lzdnqegdtgzafxeqtalfjlskyks8w](https://primal.net/e/note19ppgggdrlnytqt9ldjp0tj7482269lzdnqegdtgzafxeqtalfjlskyks8w)](https://miro.medium.com/0*C-v-OfsPcyjpQaBs.jpg)\n\n![Made this lfg all roads lead to Bitcoin BOOM it's true tho](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZHiawvjydwnBpZViyYFTNg.png)\n\nI hear there's this thing called reflexivity. Picture it as that one charismatic friend who convinces you cargo shorts are the epitome of fashion. Suddenly, everyone's sporting them, and voil√† - they're trendy. Not because they're inherently stylish, but because the collective belief made it so. It's the financial world's version of a self-fulfilling prophecy, where perception shapes reality. In Bitcoin's realm, it's as if we're all playing an epic game of financial telephone, where the whisper \"Bitcoin's going up\" amplifies into a roar with each enthusiastic retelling.\n\nNow, why might Bitcoin's price chart start resembling a hockey stick that's been working out? For starters, it already does in many spots on the chart if you zoom out.\n\n![[https://bitbo.io/](https://bitbo.io/)](https://miro.medium.com/1*uAwpd1WoxJnV1RweLZRMyw.png)\n\nYet Bitcoin will continue playing hard to get. With a cap of 21 million coins, it's the ultimate digital scarcity play. Imagine if Willy Wonka made only 21 golden tickets - then vanished in a puff of chocolate smoke. You'd bet your last Everlasting Gobstopper that folks would go bananas trying to snag one.\n\nThen there's the halving - Bitcoin's periodic crash diet. Every few years, it slashes new coin production in half, making mining more challenging than extracting a straight answer from a politician. This scarcity spectacle is investor catnip, triggering a frenzy that makes Black Friday shoppers look positively zen.\n\nBut wait, there's more! When Wall Street bigwigs start eyeing Bitcoin like it's the last slice of pizza at 2 AM, you know the game's changing. It's akin to your grandma suddenly crushing it on TikTok - you realize it's not just a passing fad. Sure, not everyone's thrilled about BlackRock crashing the crypto party, just like teens cringe at Nana's dance moves, but resistance is futile in both cases.\n\nDon't forget the government's grudging nod of approval. When Washington suits stop treating Bitcoin like a rebellious teen and start seeing it as a potential ally, it's game on. This stamp of legitimacy is like scoring the cool teacher as your school dance chaperone - suddenly, everyone's RSVP'ing 'yes.'\n\nHere's where the reflexivity rollercoaster hits ludicrous speed. As Bitcoin's price soars higher than a SpaceX rocket, the \"Bitcoin to the moon!\" chorus becomes deafening. This isn't garden-variety FOMO; it's FOMO with a megaphone and a jetpack. The belief in Bitcoin's unstoppable ascent becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, like thinking you're invisible and everyone inexplicably plays along.\n\nTop it off with global economies printing money faster than a counterfeiter on caffeine, and Bitcoin starts looking like the only adult in the room. It's the financial equivalent of bringing a juicy steak to a vegan potluck - suddenly, it's the belle of the ball, and everyone's ditching their quinoa salad for a slice of that rare, digital beef.\n\nSo there you have it - Bitcoin's potential price explosion isn't just about cold, hard numbers or tech jargon. It's a perfect storm of scarcity, hype, big money moves, and a dash of economic rebellion, all wrapped up in a reflexivity burrito. It's enough to make even the most stoic investor strap on rocket boots and bellow, \"To infinity and beyond!\" Just remember, in the wild world of Bitcoin, what goes up might come down... before rocketing to even loftier heights. It's like financial bungee jumping, but with memes, laser eyes, and a bungee cord that stretches a little higher with each exhilarating bounce!\n\nPlease don't just take my word for it. While I'm convinced Bitcoin is the world's greatest money and poised for stratospheric growth, this is all my opinion and speculation. I urge you to dive into your own research before considering Bitcoin as your financial lifeboat. That way, if this digital gold does a 2x, 3x, or even 4x moonshot measured against the endless sea of fiat, you won't be tempted to trade your hard-earned Bitcoin for paper that governments can print faster than teenagers can post TikToks. Knowledge is power, and in the wild west of digital assets, it's your best shield against FOMO and FUD alike. So strap on your learning boots and start exploring. Your future self will thank you for it :)\n\n9/15/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
