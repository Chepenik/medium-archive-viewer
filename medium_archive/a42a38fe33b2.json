It's ridiculous that a judge would block requiring citizenship to vote. You don't get to vote in this country if you aren't a citizen. It's not hard to understand.\n\nIn better news what a week this was. Bitcoin pumped on a lot of insanely bullish headlines. I got to catch up with the boys last night because Keenan was in town and I nailed an AI presentation at work today which was cool. I'm tired though because I was up late last night, so I'll keep this short.\n\nGod is good.\n\n4/25/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
