It is also insane how much code goes into what should be a relatively simple e-commerce app. Lot of work to be done to get this customized to how I want it, but this is a great start for building my website.\n\nI'm going to spend the rest of tonight coding so I will finish this Medium with a great tweet :)\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1816575798440263783](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1816575798440263783)](https://miro.medium.com/1*oSbxNg9IgjK5p1wRLhTnhw.png)\n\nifykyk\n\n7/25/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
