  "content": "# Day 1102\n\nSince becoming a father, I've felt drawn much closer to God. It's been an incredible shift, one that I believe is essential. The more God-fearing men we have in this world, the better this fallen place will be. The logic is simple: if you believe in God, you're far less likely to harm others because you understand the consequences not just in this life, but in the eternal one.\n\nBut it's not just about avoiding punishment; it's also about the promise. The carrot, not just the stick. Belief in God offers hope for everlasting life, a chance at peace, and the gift of living forever in the afterlife. I could delve deeper into this, but tonight, something else struck me, a glimpse, perhaps, of what it might be like to be God.\n\nIt took me about an hour and a half to get my daughter to sleep tonight. She was kicking, screaming, crying, desperate to avoid sleep. I stayed calm, sitting with her, not allowing her to leave the room. I tried everything: singing, comforting, gentle words. Eventually, she passed out while I rubbed her back. Despite my certainty that sleep was what she needed, she fought me every step of the way. My declaration that she would sleep in her room tonight didn't make a difference to her not until exhaustion finally took over.\n\nThat's when it hit me. This must be, in a small way, how God feels. He created humanity, gave Adam and Eve clear guidance, and yet they ignored Him. I knew what was best for Sloan tonight, but she fought me, just as humanity has fought against God's will since the beginning. It's a humbling parallel. Despite our stubbornness, God loves us unconditionally. He even sent His Son to die for our sins.\n\nFatherhood has given me a glimpse of that unconditional love, a love that remains despite rebellion and resistance. It's not always easy to be patient, to let lessons unfold naturally. Most humans have to learn through experience rather than instruction. Only God can truly decree things into being. That word, \"fiat,\" comes from Latin, meaning \"let it be done.\" It's funny how often I use it without fully appreciating its divine implications.\n\nTonight, I'm grateful I kept my cool. I'm grateful God let me learn this lesson so I could write about it and reflect on it. Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. I've had plenty of sin in my life. I've lied, I've let pride get in the way, and I've felt the need to force my opinions on others via my ego rather than because it was the correct thing to do. I've even had a child out of wedlock. Yet, despite all that, God is willing to forgive if I have faith. That's the power of unconditional love.\n\nUnconditional love... It's hard to comprehend. Sometimes I wonder why there's a hell, if some souls are really lost forever? I hope one day to understand if there's redemption beyond this life. I don't want anyone to be lost and tortured for eternity. But the amazing thing is that God's kingdom is open to anyone with faith.\n\nWe must all look like small crying children to God more often than not. Perspective is so important and God has gifted me some by blessing me with children. Thank you Father. I am forever grateful.\n\n3/28/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
