  "content": "# Day 313\n\nDid some Yoga this morning with my girlfriend's step-father and felt amazing afterwards. Yoga is good for the soul. Like most classes it started off slow and I found myself thinking this is a bit too easy. By the end I was shaking during certain poses and thinking I should've started my day with water instead of coffee. Oh well. You live and you learn.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most about the class is the idea of just letting go of the negative energy in your life that doesn't serve you. Easier said than done, but trying breathing out and with every breath let out negative energy. With every breath in inhale that positive energy. Good way to try. I know it sounds lame but it worked for me.\n\nAnyways, it looks like I've been accepted as a writer for Bitcoinnews.com so that's exciting expect more articles from me there.\n\nSorry to end this one short but my daughter is crying, my laptop charger is nowhere to be found, and I was watching the Eagles game today so I didn't write much. PHILLY TO THE SUPER BOWL! Love you anon. Stay positive and get rid of the negative energy that is no longer serving you.\n\n1/29/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
