  "content": "# Day 1200\n\nThe Rothschild family's fortune began with Mayer Amschel Bauer in Frankfurt, Germany, in the mid-18th century. He later changed his name to Rothschild, which means \"red shield\" in German, after the sign on his family's goldsmith business. His five sons later expanded the family's operations across Europe and the civilized world, with each becoming a financial power center.\n\nThe Rothschild family created their wealth through several key methods:\n\n- **Fractional-Reserve Banking:** Mayer Amschel Rothschild adopted the practice of **fractional-reserve banking**, which was a significant factor in the family's surpassing their competition. This practice involves lending out pieces of paper that were receipts for gold, but which were, in fact, counterfeit, meaning the receipts in circulation exceeded the gold held in reserve. This artificially expanded the money supply.\n\n- **Financing Governments and Profiting from War:** The Rothschilds became **personal bankers to many crowned heads of Europe** and conducted important transactions for the governments of England, France, Prussia, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Naples, Portugal, Brazil, and various German states throughout the first half of the 19th century.\n\n- They mastered the \"time-honored practice among financiers\" of **profiting from both sides of armed conflicts**. They often financed both sides in a conflict, which allowed them to benefit regardless of the outcome.\n\n- For example, they were able to offer better terms to the Duke of Wellington for financing his army during the Napoleonic Wars while still making a \"magnificent profit,\" even smuggling gold through France, the very country England was fighting.\n\n- The Rothschild Formula, a theoretical strategy, suggests that financial lords deliberately encourage war to stimulate profitable armaments production and keep nations perpetually in debt, thereby yielding profits for themselves. This formula has been apparent since the creation of the central-bank Mandrake Mechanism.\n\n- **Smuggling and Government Protection:** Due to their financing of both sides in conflicts and their political influence, the Rothschilds developed an **efficient smuggling apparatus** throughout Europe. The \"red shield\" on their property or vehicles was often sufficient to ensure passage through military checkpoints, allowing them to engage in a thriving black market for scarce consumer goods. This government protection generated commercial profits far in excess of the interest earned on government loans.\n\n- **Intelligence Gathering and Market Manipulation:** They operated a highly efficient **intelligence gathering system** that provided them with advance knowledge of important events, which was invaluable for making investment decisions. A notable example is Nathan Rothschild's use of early knowledge of Wellington's victory at Waterloo to manipulate the London bond market, acquiring a dominant holding of England's entire debt at a tiny fraction of its worth.\n\n- **Influence and Control over Finance:** They were immensely powerful due to their vast wealth, international reach, and independence. They influenced appointments to high office and engaged in almost daily interactions with major decision-makers, exercising influence behind the scenes. This power was so significant that James Rothschild, in 1842, stated, \"You have seen the man who is at the head of the finances of Europe,\" when approached by U.S. Treasury agents for a loan.\n\n- **Investments in America:** They developed heavy American commitments through cotton trade and loans to various states. They were the \"power\" in the First Bank of the United States, America's second central bank. Their agent, August Belmont, placed large amounts of Rothschild money into Southern state-sponsored bank bonds before the Civil War, and bought up more bonds at low prices as the war shifted to the North, intending to profit from the Union forcing Southern states to honor their pre-war debts in full.\n\nIn essence, their success was built upon a combination of financial acumen, the ability to create money through debt, strategic involvement in government financing and wars, lucrative smuggling operations, superior intelligence, and a pragmatic, often ruthless, indifference to national allegiances.\n\nAs we celebrate the 4th of July, a day of freedom and independence, we must confront the reality that our financial system is still rooted in the fractional-reserve banking pioneered by the Rothschilds. This Ponzi-like scheme inflates money supplies, manipulates markets, and funnels wealth to a select few. Bitcoin offers a way out: as American as the pursuit of liberty, yet truly global, beyond the control of any single nation. It's a powerful tool to protect your wealth from financiers who rig the game and break the rules without a second thought. This Independence Day, embrace Bitcoin's vision of financial sovereignty, a bulwark against manipulation and a step toward true economic freedom.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1941076771073343990](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1941076771073343990)](https://miro.medium.com/0*keeh6QTFeYuSLZyb)\n\nGOD BLESS THE U.S.A\n\n7/4/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
