It's remarkable that we are 50 distinct states united as one nation. The balance of power, with states retaining significant autonomy, is a testament to the brilliance of the system.\n\nOf course, the creation of a central bank undeniably led to greater centralization, but the fact that states still hold considerable rights is an incredible feature of our republic. _The Federalist Papers_ make compelling arguments for why the states should function under a unified federal government, the strongest being the need to prevent infighting. It's mind-blowing, though, that despite these arguments and the Federalists getting their way, we eventually faced a devastating Civil War - the very conflict the founders sought to avoid.\n\nIn school, we're often taught that the Civil War was solely about slavery, but it seems there was much more to it than that. Power struggles, economics, and differing visions for the future of the nation all played a part. In a sense, the Federalists won again with the preservation of the union, but I still believe the idea of state power is legitimate and worth defending.\n\nIt's truly remarkable how our system continues to uphold the separation of powers. States have the autonomy to create their own laws, fostering healthy competition and providing clear examples of what works and succeeds. This structure empowers people to choose where to live based on their values and priorities, all while enjoying the freedom to move freely across this vast nation.\n\nI'm deeply grateful to be a U.S. citizen. The ability to pursue our ambitions and travel within this vast nation is a privilege many take for granted. As they say, \"Perfect is the enemy of the good.\" This constitutional republic isn't flawless, but it's something extraordinary. For all its imperfections, I'm proud to call myself an American. I'll also note I believe Bitcoin is the equivalent of the US Constitution in Cyber Space. Equally grateful I get to watch it monetize during my youth :P\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*M6z7FoFMOFx7xAsohbWxsg.png)\n\n11/22/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
