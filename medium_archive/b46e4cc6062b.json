  "content": "# Day 1226\n\n## The Great M&M Economic Theory: A Potty Training Parable\n\n**Chapter 1: The Bathroom Mint**\n\nSo there we were, brilliant parents that we are, implementing what seemed like a foolproof potty training system: 1 M&M for pee, 2 M&Ms for poop. Simple economics, right? Input equals output. Literally.\n\nBut our little economist-in-training has drawn some... interesting conclusions about market dynamics.\n\nIn her tiny mind, we've apparently discovered the world's most efficient manufacturing process. Forget mining gold or printing money, it turns out the real treasure was inside us all along. She now genuinely believes that bathrooms are magical M&M factories, and she's the CEO of Chocolate Production Incorporated.\n\n**Chapter 2: The Unintended Consequences**\n\nThis got me thinking: if a 2-year-old can develop such a fundamental misunderstanding of cause and effect from our \"stimulus package,\" what happens when grown-ups in suits do the same thing with entire economies?\n\nPicture this: Our government officials, with the economic sophistication of toddlers, thinking that printing money creates actual wealth. \"Look! We made more dollars appear! Just like how sitting on the potty makes M&Ms appear!\"\n\n**Chapter 3: The Federal Reserve Potty Training Program**\n\nImagine Jerome Powell announcing: \"We're implementing quantitative easing because, much like bathroom visits, we've discovered that pressing buttons on computers creates prosperity. The more buttons we press, the more prosperity emerges! It's basic bathroom economics!\"\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere in Washington: \"Sir, inflation is through the roof.\"\n\n\"Have we tried giving everyone more money? That always works with my nephew's potty training.\"\n\n**Chapter 4: The Toddler Advisory Board**\n\nMaybe we need to start consulting actual 2-year-olds on policy. At least they're honest about their magical thinking:\n\n\"Daddy, why don't grown-ups just go potty more if they want more M&Ms?\"\n\n\"Well sweetie, that's essentially what the Fed is trying to do with interest rates.\"\n\n\"That's dumb, Daddy. You can't poop M&Ms forever.\"\n\nOut of the mouths of babes.\n\n**Chapter 5: The Great Reckoning**\n\nThe day of reckoning came when our little one marched into a public restroom at Target, fully expecting to collect her M&M dividend from the porcelain treasury.\n\nThe look of betrayal when no candy materialized was the same look taxpayers get when they realize government spending doesn't actually create sustainable prosperity, instead it just creates the illusion of M&Ms until the bag runs out.\n\n**Epilogue: Lessons from the Bathroom**\n\nSo here's to hoping our central planners eventually graduate from toddler-level cause-and-effect reasoning. Because while it's adorable when a 2-year-old thinks bathrooms are candy factories, it's considerably less cute when entire monetary systems are built on equally magical thinking.\n\nAt least when our potty training incentive program inevitably crashes, we'll only be out a few bags of M&Ms. When the grown-up version crashes... well, let's just say the cleanup is a lot more complicated than changing a diaper.\n\n_The real second-order effect? She's going to be the most financially literate kid in kindergarten, having learned firsthand that unsustainable incentive structures always end in tears. Or in this case, tears and a lot of unnecessary bathroom trips._\n\n![toilet covered in M&Ms](https://miro.medium.com/1*uhw5RzeElWRg8L_4tOGP3w.png)\n\n7/30/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
