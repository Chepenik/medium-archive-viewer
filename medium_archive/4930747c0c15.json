  "content": "# Day 454\n\nSometimes memes can display an idea better than words ever could. If a picture can say 1000 words than a meme can say 100,000 words because they get to use text.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*UIeNoqBlX3LCyZCG)\n\nAlso not a meme but a screen-grab can say a lot as well.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*OZTGibNYJFWNvo67z2PyQQ.png)\n\n32 trillion in debt. SHEEESHHHH not great. Almost a quarter million per tax-payer. Amazing that the Government is planning on just continuing to borrow more and more.\n\nNot good to dwell on something I can't fix. So I save in bitcoin!!! Which speaking of Bitcoin I did an awesome rip with JP Baric from miningstore.com today. It'll be released tomorrow. Really cool to chat about energy, AI, and Bitcoin with someone who has been so succesful in the crypto space.\n\n_\"And this life of the world is nothing but a sport and play; and as for the next abode, that most surely is the life, did they but know.\" -Al-Qur'an 29:64_\n\nGo out and play. Have fun figuring out how to provide value and joy to the life of others. Appreciate JP for reaching out to me about coming on the show. Appreciate my partner and our baby for being so amazing. Appreciate my parents for breathing life into me.\n\nIt's actually wild that I'm even alive and able to type this. Earlier today I was able to go for a 5 mile run and got to feel the pride of completing that. Sounds funny to say but I'm so mfing grateful that I get to live and experience what it's like to be a human being. Yea my generation has it's challenges, but in the journey of overcoming obstacles is what makes a life worth living so rewarding and enjoyable. :p\n\n6/19/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
