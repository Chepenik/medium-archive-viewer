  "content": "# Day 772\n\nIn NYC going to a Bitcoin meetup tonight. Excited to pull up to Pubkey again, one of the best Bitcoin bars in all of New York City. Also crushed a run with my buddy Keenan during lunch at work today. Amazing how good exercise makes you feel especially if you're not feeling good.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*p2Y7rAJeH0kD0Zjz2OElLQ.png)\n\nThis was the view during the run. Life is good!\n\nDon't have much else to report. Grateful I get to travel, grateful my job allows me to work from anywhere, grateful to be alive at a time where Bitcoin is creating P2P economies and redefining money in a digital age.\n\nHere is to a brighter future!\n\n5/2/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
