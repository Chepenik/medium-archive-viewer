  "content": "# Day 914\n\n![I bet Claude Shannon would have enjoyed an AI image of himself](https://miro.medium.com/1*0c1Rx2dlGqtpo8Cr09EOYg.png)\n\nI have been [reading about Claude Shannon](https://amzn.to/3ZtoKGk) and what truly stands out is his approach to problem-solving. Shannon had a knack for dissecting complex problems into their most basic elements. His development of information theory exemplifies this method by stripping away the redundant, and reducing concepts to their core. From this simplicity, solutions emerge clearly, and when scaled back to their original complexity, the problem is solved.\n\nIt's remarkable how applicable this principle is in life. Humans often tend to overcomplicate matters - whether it's through over-explaining, over-engineering, or over-analysis. Shannon's methodology reminds us of the value in simplicity. 'Keep it simple, stupid' isn't just a saying; it's a powerful strategy for clarity and efficiency in both thought and action. Less is more is another good example of this principal.\n\nIn essence, complexity is often a crutch - a way to mask uncertainty or lack of understanding. Embracing simplicity, on the other hand, requires courage. It demands that we confront the core of an issue, strip away our assumptions, and present ideas in their most naked, vulnerable form. This process can be uncomfortable, but it's through this crucible of simplification that truly revolutionary ideas are born and refined.\n\n9/21/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
