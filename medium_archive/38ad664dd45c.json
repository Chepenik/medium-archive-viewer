  "content": "# Day 481\n\n![Generated on nightcafe](https://miro.medium.com/0*DLLTHgV6R8NSsPAs)\n\nToday I definitely ate more food than I should have. I felt slow and lethargic all day because of it, but that's alright the food I scarfed down was so good. I made sure to eat slow, but it was still too much after going without food for seven days. Followed this up by spending the rest of the day either playing with my daughter or watching Barry on HBO. A much lazier Sunday than I planned on having but that's okay because recharging is important.\n\nWhen I finally went to get on my ghost writing call at 6PM today it felt pretty good to be productive. Followed that up by writing this. Life is a paradox because being productive felt so good but so did not doing anything all day.\n\nI have absolutely no clue what the lesson is there. Maybe do more productive stuff if they both feel good? ðŸ˜‚  I asked AI for the lesson and it said \"If we are always productive, we will eventually burn out. If we are always relaxed, we will not get anything done. The key is to find a healthy balance between the two.\" Excellent point from a large language model. Another good point it had is \"In fact, doing nothing can sometimes be even more productive than being productive. When we take a break from our work, we give our minds and bodies a chance to rest and recharge. This can actually make us more productive in the long run.\" This reminds me of when I go for a casual walk or take a shower and a fantastic idea comes to me. By letting our minds rest often our subconscious can go to work and let our conscious on some profound insights.\n\nBetween writing this line and the one before it I went for a run. Every time I run I'm reminded how good exercise feels for the body. Anyways, until tomorrow anon!\n\n7/16/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
