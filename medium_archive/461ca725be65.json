  "content": "# Day 1241\n\nI watched the Twin Peaks pilot with my lady tonight and I'm reminded why David Lynch is the goat. Man that was some excellent television. The score in the show is elite as well.\n\n![I want this police car from Twin Peaks](https://miro.medium.com/1*Rv2-n5y_bAgItGKMPgq2VA.jpeg)\n\nThis is also my new dream car. Would love an old Bronco with the Twin Peaks sticker on the side.\n\n![\"Harry, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Every day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don't plan it. Don't wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the men's store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot black coffee.\"](https://miro.medium.com/0*fcSp6fRG3aMkAiBE.jpg)\n\nGlad to see my lady is now invested in the show and wants to watch more episodes. Can't wait to rewatch the first two seasons and finally watch the movie and the third season they made 25 years later.\n\n8/14/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
