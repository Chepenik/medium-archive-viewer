  "content": "# Finding Joy In The Little Things\n\nSeems like in the age of the internet it's becoming harder and harder to not worry about all the awful things going on in the world. War, killing, cyberattacks, every day brings a new set of challenges. We are constantly being reminded how finite life is when you turn on the news. Sadly, rather than celebrating I feel an existential dread when I read/ listen/ watch the news. I need to stop spending so much time worrying about things outside of my control. Easier said than done but even writing out my feelings is a helpful form of therapy.\n\nI have so much to be grateful for in my life. A nice apartment, a girlfriend that loves me, a job I enjoy because my co-workers are amazing people who help make cold calling enjoyable. The more I remind myself how much I have to be grateful for the better off I will be. Life is short and we could die at any moment so spend more time enjoying the little things, acknowledging your gratitude for them, and stop worrying about things outside of your control.\n\n5/19/21\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
