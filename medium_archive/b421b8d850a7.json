  "content": "# Day 763\n\nToday I sat in the square of a busy part of town after eating dinner with my parents and laid in the grass. My family and me proceeded to do cart wheels, walk on our hands, and take our shoes off so we could touch the grass. From an outsider looking on this might've seemed like crazy behavior, but I don't care.\n\nEvery moment presents a choice: to cherish it or to let it slip away in regret. While social norms serve a purpose, they needn't be followed rigidly all the time. It's perfectly acceptable to remove your shoes and revel in the simple pleasure of touching the earth beneath your feet. It's alright to let loose and enjoy yourself in public spaces. It's okay to embrace your silly side in certain situations.\n\nLife is too fleeting to take it too seriously all the time. Savor the little joys, the moments of pure whimsy, and the freedom to be unapologetically yourself. Don't let the weight of expectations crush the playful spirit within you. Having a child was the perfect way to constantly remind myself of this.\n\n4/23/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
