If you think Brian's breakfast is more nutritious than Elon's then you are likely a victim of Government propaganda.\n\nRed meat is some of the healthiest food in the world. Don't fall for the psy-op of this ridiculous food pyramid.\n\n![[https://x.com/thecarnivorebar/status/1813589505385066865](https://x.com/thecarnivorebar/status/1813589505385066865)](https://miro.medium.com/0*gioEjBsvGlFbeeEw)\n\nAnyways, it was a great Birthday. 9/10ths of the way to 30. Grateful for my family and amazed by how quickly life goes by.\n\n7/17/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
