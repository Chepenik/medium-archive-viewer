  "content": "# Day 917\n\nI'm working with a friend to improve this website [https://www.thecommonsensemovement.com/](https://www.thecommonsensemovement.com/)\n\nI'd like to improve the following things:\n\nA new UI. From something like this\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*2e1IDoQX-mq9WeAi5lEhkw.png)\n\nto this\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*1C0ZlZUdhIU6704RhD-Bwg.png)\n\nI had v0.dev design me the bottom one. Man it's awesome how fast these AI tools are coming along.\n\n**Category 1: Quick and Easy Wins**\n\nImprove site navigation. Streamline the menu structure, add a search function, and implement breadcrumbs for better user orientation. Mobile optimization should be prioritized to ensure a responsive design across all devices, optimize loading times for mobile users, and implement touch-friendly navigation.\n\nSocial media integration will help expand the site's reach. This involves adding social media sharing buttons to all pages, displaying social media feeds on the site, and creating shareable content for each platform. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for improving visibility. This includes conducting keyword research, optimizing page titles, meta descriptions, and headers, and improving site speed and performance.\n\nTo foster community engagement, adding a forum or discussion board is recommended. This involves implementing a discussion platform, creating topic categories aligned with the movement's goals, and moderating discussions to ensure quality conversations.\n\n**Category 2: Long-Term Goals**\n\nDeveloping a premium membership can provide additional value to dedicated followers. This includes creating exclusive content for paid members, implementing a secure payment system, and offering tiered membership levels with different benefits. A user authentication system will be necessary to support this, involving the development of a secure login system, creation of user profiles with customizable settings, and implementation of password recovery and account management features.\n\nAn event management feature can help build a stronger community. This involves adding a calendar for upcoming events and meetups, allowing users to create and promote their own events, and implementing an RSVP system and attendance tracking. To provide educational resources, an online learning platform can be developed. This includes creating a course creation and management system, developing a variety of courses on common sense topics, and implementing progress tracking and certificates of completion.\n\nAn advanced SEO strategy will help improve the site's visibility in the long term. This involves developing a comprehensive keyword strategy, creating a link-building campaign, and regularly analyzing and adjusting SEO efforts based on performance. A robust content strategy and management plan is crucial for maintaining engagement. This includes an editorial calendar, curating user-generated content, and implementing a content recommendation system.\n\nEstablishing thought leadership will help position the site as a go-to resource. This can be achieved by publishing in-depth articles and whitepapers, hosting webinars and online events, and collaborating with influencers and experts in related fields.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nTo move forward, it's important to prioritize the quick wins and begin implementation. Create a roadmap for long-term goals with clear milestones. Regularly review and update the improvement plan based on user feedback and site analytics to ensure continued growth and relevance of the Common Sense Movement website.\n\nLet's go!\n\n9/24/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
