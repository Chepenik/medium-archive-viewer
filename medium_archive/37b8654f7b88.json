Your data is harvested, analyzed, and sold to the highest bidder. But someone is fighting back. On the battleground of financial privacy, [Cakewallet](https://cakewallet.com/) stands guard against the prying eyes of big data, striving to keep your digital wealth as private as the cash in your pocket.\n\nIn a recent interview, [Seth For Privacy - VP of Operations at Cakewallet](https://x.com/sethforprivacy), shared insights into the company's mission and the broader implications of financial privacy in the digital age.\n\n![Connect with Seth on X: [https://x.com/sethforprivacy](https://x.com/sethforprivacy)](https://miro.medium.com/0*V756hmpGK9Qt8SSx)\n\n\"Privacy in any digital asset, be that Bitcoin, Monero, whatever, is vital for any of those to actually be Freedom money,\" Seth explained. This statement cuts to the heart of Cakewallet's philosophy. While many tout Bitcoin as a tool for financial freedom, Seth argues that without robust privacy features, it falls short of this ideal in certain scenarios.\n\nThe challenge lies in the transparent nature of Bitcoin's blockchain. Every transaction is visible, creating a digital trail that can potentially be traced back to individuals. This transparency, while extremely useful for many purposes including verifying the hard cap of 21 million bitcoin, can be a significant drawback for users seeking true financial privacy.\n\nCakewallet is taking a multi-pronged approach to address these privacy concerns. The company supports multiple digital assets, with a particular focus on Bitcoin and Monero. Monero, known for its strong default privacy features, is a cornerstone of Cakewallet's offerings.\n\n\"We're focusing on making a very, very user-friendly wallet for Monero [which] brings financial privacy to a lot more people,\" Seth noted. This emphasis on user experience is crucial, as privacy tools are only effective if people actually use them.\n\nSeth highlighted a beautiful aspect of the cryptocurrency ecosystem: the freedom of choice. \"That's one of the beautiful things with cryptocurrency as opposed to fiat is you're not forced into using any of them. You get to choose what you use. It's an opt-in system and that's a beautiful thing,\" he explained. This optionality allows users to select the level of privacy that best suits their needs, whether it's the transparent nature of Bitcoin or the enhanced privacy features of Monero.\n\nSeth's enthusiasm for Monero goes beyond just its privacy features. He emphasized that Monero shouldn't be dismissed as a shitcoin. \"Almost every bitcoiner that I've ever talked to who's actually genuine... will not put Monero in the shitcoin camp because if you understand how it works, how it was created, you you can't consider it a shitcoin,\" Seth explained. He pointed out that Monero shares similarities with Bitcoin, such as its proof-of-work consensus mechanism, albeit with a unique ASIC-resistant algorithm designed to maintain decentralization. Seth's respect for Monero stems from its technical merits, commitment to privacy, and the thoughtful design choices made by its developers. However, Seth still wishes to see better privacy on Bitcoin itself.\n\nFor Bitcoin, Cakewallet is working on implementing advanced privacy features. One such feature is Payjoin, a technique that makes it harder to trace Bitcoin transactions. \"We're working on Payjoin support in Cake right now with the new Payjoin V2 spec that [Dan Gould](https://x.com/bitgould) built out, which is really really cool,\" Seth revealed. This implementation of Payjoin, specifically designed for Bitcoin, demonstrates Cakewallet's commitment to enhancing privacy across different digital assets.\n\n![Payjoin V2 peers go on and offline and still make a payjoin. V2 lets even web wallets receive payjoin any time to optimize for fees and default to better privacy.

He emphasized that Lightning's privacy benefits largely depend on how it's implemented and used. While Lightning can offer some privacy advantages, Seth cautioned that it's not a silver bullet. The privacy gained through Lightning can vary significantly based on factors such as whether users run their own nodes and how they manage their channels. This nuanced view underscores the complexity of achieving robust privacy in the Bitcoin ecosystem and the need for multiple complementary solutions.\n\n![The Bitcoin Lightning Network Visualized via [https://lnrouter.app/graph](https://lnrouter.app/graph)](https://miro.medium.com/1*kNBY4Biy5OKGT-Pl_nuZUw.png)\n\nPerhaps the most exciting development Seth discussed is Cakewallet's implementation of Silent Payments for Bitcoin. This feature allows users to receive payments without revealing their wallet address, significantly enhancing privacy.\n\n\"Cakewallet is the only place to actually use Silent Payments as both sender and receiver today,\" Seth proudly stated. This puts Cakewallet at the cutting edge of Bitcoin privacy technology.\n\n![Check out Cake Wallet @ [https://cakewallet.com/](https://cakewallet.com/)](https://miro.medium.com/1*IyHVASuYrATiLDwFsZvDOA.png)\n\nAnother one of the key aspects of Cakewallet's approach is its commitment to open-source development. Seth emphasized several benefits of this approach:\n\n1. Security: \"A project being open source is actually a really powerful security tool,\" Seth explained. By allowing anyone to examine the code, potential vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed more quickly.\n\n2. Ecosystem growth: Open-source code allows other developers to build upon Cakewallet's work, benefiting the entire digital asset privacy ecosystem.\n\n3. Transparency: Users can verify for themselves how the wallet works, building trust in the platform.\n\nCakewallet's efforts extend beyond just creating a privacy-focused wallet. By developing and promoting these technologies, they're pushing the entire digital asset industry towards better privacy practices.\n\nAs Seth put it, \"The real big driver for me coming to Cake is that I can... really try to take a bigger perspective and build better privacy tools for Bitcoin.\" This mission has implications not just for individual users, but for the future of digital finance as a whole.\n\nAs digital assets continue to reshape the financial landscape, the need for robust privacy solutions becomes ever more critical. Cakewallet, with its focus on user-friendly privacy tools and open-source development, is positioning itself as a leader in this crucial field.\n\nAt Bitcoin News, while our focus is exclusively on Bitcoin as the most important digital asset and the only true form of digital scarcity, we appreciate Seth's broader interest in privacy-enhancing technologies across different cryptocurrencies. His dedication to improving privacy in Bitcoin, while also recognizing the strengths of other projects like Monero in this area, demonstrates a commitment to the fundamental principle of financial privacy. We believe that this cross-pollination of ideas and technologies can ultimately benefit Bitcoin and its users, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of privacy and fungibility in the world's leading cryptocurrency.\n\nFor those interested in exploring digital asset privacy, Seth recommends visiting silentpayments.xyz for more information on this cutting-edge technology.\n\n![You can learn more at [https://silentpayments.xyz/](https://silentpayments.xyz/)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ciEOHW3_Heht-f1w0TFpeg.png)\n\nIn a world where financial data is increasingly valuable and vulnerable, Cakewallet is working to ensure that the promise of digital assets as \"freedom money\" remains more than just a slogan. As the digital economy evolves, privacy-focused tools like those developed by Cakewallet may well become essential for anyone looking to truly own their financial future.\n\n8/21/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
