The forgotten ecstasy of gliding upon a wooden vessel with wheels resurfaced within me. My past endeavors as a skateboarding enthusiast were marred by my inherent lack of skill, but the art of long boarding seemed to embrace me with open arms, beckoning me towards newfound ease. Riding can be a cathartic experience. Today reminded me of the last time I rode dirt-bikes. The thought at the back of my head is I will eat shit if I fall so be careful. The thought at the front of my mind is this is so fun I want to do this forever.\n\nWithin this seemingly mundane act of riding a longboard, a profound philosophical insight arises. Life, too, bears resemblance to such an endeavor. It is a perpetual balancing act between caution and the pursuit of pleasure, where the prospect of failure is an ever-present specter. Just as I rode, acutely aware of the potential consequences, our existence demands that we exercise caution and consider the risks at hand.\n\nHowever, the true essence lies not solely in the avoidance of failure, but in the sheer delight derived from the experience itself. The longboard, an emblem of our existence in this analogy, invites us to embrace the joyous moments that beckon us, to revel in the exuberance of the present, despite the specter of potential failure. It is in this delicate interplay that life's ultimate meaning resides: a delicate dance of caution and the relentless pursuit of bliss.\n\nTherefore, let us cast aside the fear of stumbling, for it is through the very act of daring greatly that life's truest, most profound joys await us. Engage in this cosmic ride with resolute courage, accepting the risks with open eyes, and revel in the boundless exhilaration that awaits the intrepid wanderer of existence. It is through overcoming our greatest challenges that we derive the most joy out of life ðŸ«¡\n\n7/2/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
