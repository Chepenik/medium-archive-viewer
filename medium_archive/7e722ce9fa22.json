  "content": "# Day 809\n\nThis interview was amazing. Worth the watch if you want a white pill that not everyone in Congress is a corrupt, power hungry, lobbyist puppet. We need to get more people like Massie into positions of power.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FomBSEuFTYEo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DomBSEuFTYEo&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FomBSEuFTYEo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube\" title=\"\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe>\n\nThomas Massie's stance against the CARES Act in March 2020 stands as a testament to his extraordinary political bravery and unwavering principles. As the sole member of Congress to oppose this $2 trillion stimulus bill, Massie faced immense pressure and backlash from his colleagues, media, and even the President. Yet, his resolute commitment to fiscal responsibility and constitutional principles prevailed over the overwhelming consensus.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*_3qeStwCU5IrgvYYgXQgOA.png)\n\nDriving to Washington D.C. amidst a global pandemic to ensure a quorum and demand accountability, Massie defied the political tide that sought unanimous support for the bill. His actions underscored the importance of rigorous scrutiny, especially when dealing with unprecedented government spending. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to the DC leviathan, and Massie's resolve showcased a rare fortitude.\n\nMassie's opposition was rooted in his belief that the CARES Act would lead to significant long-term consequences such as massive inflation and the erosion of the middle class. The ensuing economic conditions, marked by inflationary pressures, validated his concerns. By standing alone in his opposition, Massie demonstrated a rare courage, prioritizing the nation's fiscal health over political expediency.\n\nIn an era where political conformity often overshadows individual conviction, Massie's stance serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of dissent in a healthy democracy. History will look back on Massie as an America-first patriot who put his country first, rather than the fiscal interests of the uber-wealthy who understood this stimulus would pump their assets and did not care about the resulting inflation, which has been crippling the lower classes of America ever since.\n\nHis actions reflect an unwavering dedication to the principles of limited government and fiscal prudence. For this, Thomas Massie's bravery deserves recognition as one of the most courageous acts in the history of the United States Congress. His willingness to stand alone, guided by principle and foresight, exemplifies true statesmanship, earning him the enduring gratitude of those who value the integrity of the American experiment.\n\nAnd let's not forget, Massie is the only politician who doesn't seem to have an AIPAC guy in his ear. He built his own house, for crying out loud. While he's way more of a liberty-leaning Republican than the RINOs that fill the halls of Congress, it's pretty ironic that a Republican is by far the greenest members of Congress. This guy's got layers. Massie's unique blend of independence, environmental awareness, hacker mindset, and unwavering commitment to liberty makes him a standout in a sea of conformity.\n\n6/8/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
