  "content": "# Day 471\n\nToday I had a feel good conversation on Nostr. When you take the time to reply thoughtfully to an insult, rather than escalate the conversation by hurling an insult back, you will often find people are reasonable.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*-zDJfKcZU3n9kiM2Cw6JHQ.png)\n\nI'm not going to lie I was ready to hurl some insults back but luckily I was on a run and used better judgement. The end result: the person thanked me for the thoughtful reply and I even ended up zapping them 69 satoshis. Here are screenshots from the conversation on Nostr I am referring to.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*HNAvinrlAJHAhclPn64heA.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*D2kRhsNOeHqQETt9Fs3fzQ.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*XRFdBmPVFM34Joq9BO-Cfg.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*k1UjH6R7PfbMY0ErhVWKPw.png)\n\nFrom wanting to insult this user to zapping them actual value. What a difference meditating and thinking before I speak (or type in this case lol) can make. A lesson I need to heed more in my day to day life. If you choose anger over kindness when someone is rude to you the end result is guaranteed to be negative. If you take a step back, do your best to address the issue, and reply in a more respectful kind manner you might just make a difference.\n\nI hope world leaders can consider this when thinking about escalating war. There are never any winners in war, just a lot of losers and those who don't lose as bad. Few.\n\n7/6/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
