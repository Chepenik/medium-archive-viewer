  "content": "# Day 428\n\nToday I saw that Boston's Museum Of Science had an opening for the Web Developer position. I went ahead and applied. I believe in using this medium to hone my writing skills so here is my cover letter. I can always improve my writing, but I think putting it online in the open makes me hone in on doing a quality job. Here is to finding my next web developer role :)\n\n> [**Home | Museum of Science, Boston**](https://www.mos.org/)\n\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my strong interest in the Web Developer position at the Museum of Science. With a solid background in web development, a passion for innovation, and a deep appreciation for the Museum's impactful educational efforts in the Boston area, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to your team.\n\nIn early 2022, I embarked on a self-taught journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which led me to successfully design and launch websites from scratch, including the MassAdoption website -both a startup and meetup in the greater Boston area. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also provided me with practical experience in deploying websites using platforms like Hostinger. As mentioned in the job description, I am highly proficient in developing and customizing websites from the ground up.\n\nIn 2023, I decided to further focus and refine my skills, leading me to discover Launch Academy, a top-tier computer science bootcamp. As an Apprentice Full Stack Developer at Launch Academy, I immersed myself in agile methodologies, collaborative development practices, and test-driven development. Through activities such as pair programming, lightning talks, and a continuous thirst for knowledge, I have built a strong foundation in creating web applications. My expertise aligns seamlessly with the position's requirements, encompassing web development experience, proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also backend experience with Node.js.\n\nHaving personally explored the Museum of Science, I have been inspired by its unwavering commitment to innovation and education. It is with genuine excitement that I seize the opportunity to contribute to the development of your web assets, applications, and interactive experiences. I firmly believe that my technical expertise, creativity, and unwavering dedication to excellence align perfectly with the Museum's values and vision.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I eagerly anticipate the possibility of joining your team and contributing to the Museum's mission of fostering innovation and creativity. I am available at your convenience for an interview and would be delighted to provide any additional information you may require. Thank you for your time and kind consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConor Chepenik\n\n5/24/23",
