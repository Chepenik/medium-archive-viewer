  "content": "# Day 1212\n\nMan I love steak. Whole Foods has these pre-seasoned meats they sell which I highly recommend. The carne asada I had for lunch today was delicious. Also they had a pork bulgogi I ate the other day which was incredible.\n\nAmazing how much value you can create with a finished product. Food for thought.\n\nI need to finish my Bitcoin Coloring Book.\n\n7/16/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
