  "content": "# Day 633\n\nToday was a solid Friday I got to enjoy free BBQ for lunch at my job (shout out my team lead). Later, I enjoyed a delightful dinner with my partner, father, and child, which was the highlight of my evening. I'm filled with gratitude for these moments.\n\nThe dinner was so delicious and comforting that I accidentally dozed off while putting my daughter to bed. Now I'm up to finish my writing for the day.\n\nI don't have much to write about. I'll note my seven books by Robert Greene came in. Looking forward to reading those. I started the first page of War and it was fascinating. It made the point we prepare for peace but life is war. Something that seems so obvious yet something I would wager most of us never even consider.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*uwtNqUvfPeQhvSVd.jpg)\n\n12/15/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
