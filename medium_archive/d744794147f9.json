I'm genuinely blown away by how far these models have come. It brought back that same wonder I felt when they first dropped. Except now, everything is sharper, faster, and more intuitive.\n\nWhat's even more exciting is this: just like social media converged around similar patterns, every model will eventually adopt these creative capabilities too. Editing and stylizing images with a single prompt is only going to get better from here.\n\nHow can you not be bullish on the future?\n\n3/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
