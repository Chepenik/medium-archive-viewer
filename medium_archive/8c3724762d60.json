  "content": "# Day 691\n\nWhat an excellent Sunday. Played golf with my buddy, enjoyed food at the super bowl with my family, and read the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. Congrats to the Chiefs on a big W.\n\nI wanted the 49ers to win because it saddened me to see Kelce become a Pfizer shill but I do like to see Andy Reid catch all these Ws. He is a great coach and gave the Eagles many good years.\n\nOne of my favorite moments at the super bowl this year was Dorsey wearing a Satoshi shirt. Amazing how fast these memetic images can spread.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*xLhYTQ4mvVysGOrq6YATZw.png)\n\nMany Bitcoiners, myself included were celebrating this. It might not have been an ETF add, but it is a badass shirt for those who know...Ifykyk.\n\nAnyways, I feel grateful and when you feel gratitude life is amazing. I'm blessed to have family, friends, sports to play & watch, and my health. God is good.\n\n2/11/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
