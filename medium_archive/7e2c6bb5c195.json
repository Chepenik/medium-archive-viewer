  "content": "# Day 970\n\nThe smell of campfire smoke is one of life's simple pleasures. It clings to your clothes, embedding itself in the fabric as a smoky reminder of nights under the stars. Luckily, I love the scent, so I don't mind carrying it with me. Just like campfire smoke, quality experiences and things tend to linger and hold value to those with a discerning eye. So be someone who has said eye ;)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*Ze_1xcPfOY3gOWlo)\n\n11/16/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
