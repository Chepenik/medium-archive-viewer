  "content": "# Day 279\n\nThe day after Christmas is always a nice chill day. Got a hungry man special at my favorite diner (coffee, 2 eggs, bacon, hasbrowns with onion, and french toast). Followed that up by getting my lulu lemon jacket replaced because it had a hole torn in it. Then my partner and I came home and completely rearranged the apartment. I'm glad it's done because sheeeeeesh. Moving couches and beds is not a fun task. Big ups to those in the moving business.\n\nCooked up some flame as we finished up rearranging (last night's salmon & broccoli with 5 eggs plus some bacon). Then I put on some nice tunes and started writing today's medium. Crazy to think 2023 is right around the corner. Some things I would like to focus on for the new year are improving my coding skills, become a better writer, read more, run at least 40 miles every month, continue to stay humble & stack sats, and finally hit 10k Twitter followers by the end of the year. These are all great goals but how will I achieve them? Well let's go one by one.\n\nI will commit to finishing Replit's 100 days of code. I've been doing it on and off but starting today I'm going to make sure I do a lesson every day until it's finished. Just like with these mediums I'm going to make it a part of my routine. BANG BANG!\n\nBecome a better writer?! Easy continue to do these and start to prep for my own blog on Binmucker.com when I hit 365 days on here. It's been great writing on here, but I'd like to start self-hosting my own blog. I bought a year's worth of web hosting for Mass Adoption and with it came a free domain and the ability to host multiple websites so it will be a win-win. I'll continue writing everyday as well as learning how to build and host my own website. LOVE IT LET'S KEEP THIS GRAVVVVYYYYY TRAIN ROLLING.\n\nCommiting now 10 pages a day. It's done. Considered that goal crushed baby. If I can do 10 pages every day that means I will have read 3,650 at a minumum by the end of the year. The Bible I got right now is 4000 pages so I'll at least be close if that's the only book I read. However, I've found that just setting out to read 10 pages will likely lead to me reading more pages. So hopefully at the end of the year we are more near 10,000 pages but will see.\n\n40 miles every month. I finished this year strong by getting at least 30 miles for the last 4â€“5 months. Can't remember exactly how many months I did this for. Doesn't matter though. I found it was a fantastic way to hold myself accountable. Doing 30 per month wasn't too crazy. 40 isn't either but it will take some adapting. GOOD.\n\nHow will I stay humble & stack sats? I'd like to do more value for value stuff. Bitcoin is allowing for a completely new system where people can monetize their online presence so I need to start taking advantage of this. Finding ways when I host my own blog to put in little lightning tip jars and asking people to donate if they found my work valuable. Also continuing to build out clothes on spri.ng It's a dope website and they make it so easy to build any clothing you want. Plus, they take care of all the back end stuff. I've only created one design which you can check out here if you are interested.\n\n[https://chep.creator-spring.com/listing/btcsunrise](https://chep.creator-spring.com/listing/btcsunrise)\n\nThe final goal?! 10K Twitter followers by the end of the year. Very manageable I just need to post more. So going forward I'm going to do a thread on the 10 pages I read when I find that what I read is worth sharing. I don't want to make this a daily thing because I'm going for quality over quantity threads. It seems like there is a lot of noise and not so much signal with the accounts that just post thread after thread. By finetuning my threads I think more people will continue to follow me because they enjoy what I have to say. I also plan to improve my meme game. Like threads it's important to leverage memes that are actually funny, but it can be done.\n\nAnyways, this is what I'm looking forward to crushing in 2023 as well as being a new Dad. Exciting times ahead. Maybe I'll mes up sometimes but these are solid goals to strive towards. Excited for what the future holds!\n\n12/26/22\n\nConor Jay CHEPENIK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
