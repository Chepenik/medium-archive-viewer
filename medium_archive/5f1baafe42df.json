It explores how centralizing the control of gold reserves enabled an expansion of lending practices by banks. However, the subsequent inflation eroded the purchasing power of the lower and middle classes.\n\nBitcoin, being a decentralized and deflationary form of money, presents an alternative monetary system designed to be resistant to debasement by any centralized authority or fractional reserve lending practices. It's worth watching the ~30 minute film to understand why it's so powerful.\n\nI prefer my money to have a store of value function instead of a means of control one. The state prefers the opposite. Society flourishes under a hard money standard. Broken money just leads to all sorts of issues.\n\nFix the money, improve the world. Bad money = bad outcomes. Good money, we at least got a much better chance for good outcomes.\n\nFuture looks bright :)\n\n5/9/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
