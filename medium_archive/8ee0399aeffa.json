  "content": "# Day 399\n\nHey I just want y'all to know I am more than these data packets that fly around the internet. One day an AI will be able to take all my data and make a damn near perfect copy of me. It will never get the exact essence of Conor Chepenik though. Just not happening. Like approaching a 99.99999999999999% success rate and just not ever being able to touch 100 no matter how many nines get added. That said, I think it will be cool for younger generations to chat with their artificial ancestors.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*0lnKN-VZwjS3UQJc)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*zEz1KzgZq1E2J2lR)\n\n4/25/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
