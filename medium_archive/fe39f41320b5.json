  "content": "# Day 410\n\nThis weekend my partner's parents came up which was nice. They helped us get our apartment in our order. Including getting us a rug for our balcony, fixing our outdoor chairs, and getting our child a new bed because she has outgrown her crib. I appreciate them driving up to Boston from New Jersey. They even watched Sloan while my partner and I went and watched the Super Mario Brothers movie.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*FxJNVPcrrf5gr1QF)\n\nThe movie was decent. Definitely a kids film but I laughed and very much enjoyed being back inside a movie theater. Pretty sure this is the first time I've been back to the cinema since my child was born.\n\nSpent some time today coding as well. Fixed up some things on the MassAdoption website. Lazy Saturday vibes but it was also incredible weather. So nice seeing people walking around and enjoying the fresh air.\n\nFinally, I'd like to note I have an interview with Zeebedee this coming Friday. I'm very excited to speak with them. It would be a sales role and I'd like to find a coding role, but the position would give me a chance to work along the engineering team so it would be well worth it. The company's open source, nbd, built the Nostr protocol so I'll take any job I can get at Zeebedee and contribute to open source projects in my free time to keep my coding skills. Will see how it plays out but wanted to note this because working at a Bitcoin company is something I'm very interested in doing! :)\n\n5/6/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
