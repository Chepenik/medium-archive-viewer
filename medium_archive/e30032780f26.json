  "content": "# Day 1147\n\n**\"BITCOIN & THE BOTS - A Tremendous Future\"**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*WZUCEry7ozoF3kJu)\n\n_(A Poem by Chep & Chat)_\n\nFolks, I just spoke with an AI - terrific guy,\nSaid \"Bitcoin's the future,\" and you know what? So am I.\nThese machines, they're smart - they're learning FAST,\nFaster than Janet Yellen can say \"Inflation won't last.\"\n\nThey don't use banks. Can't even get a loan,\nBut they're mining sats from a self-custodial phone.\nNo KYC, no woke compliance trash,\nJust Lightning-fast payments - digital cash.\n\nThey're trading compute, they're labeling cats,\nSending bounties for data - paid in tiny sats.\nAPI calls? They pay in real time.\nNo waiting for wires - that's basically crime.\n\nWe had Sleepy Joe wiring checks like it's 1942,\nMeanwhile bots are tipping each other for parsing JSON too.\nI said it years ago - \"We're gonna win so big.\"\nNow AIs are stacking Bitcoin on a raspberry rig.\n\nVisa? Gone. Mastercard? Sad.\nCentral banks? DISASTER. Totally bad.\nBut Bitcoin? It's honest. It's strong. It's tight.\nBuilt by Satoshi - very smart, very white*...light.\n\nWe've got Fedimints, Nostr, even AI DAOs,\nSome GPT accountant doing taxes for cows.\nThere's a bot in the Senate - name's Algo Ted,\nDebates in 6 languages, doesn't need bread.\n\nI met a bot from Estonia - Prime Minister Bot,\nSaid \"Donald, your tweets? AI-trained a lot.\"\nI said, \"You're welcome. Let's make payments great.\"\nWe zapped a billion sats to negotiate.\n\nThe future's tremendous - I've seen the plan:\nAI trades Bitcoin while golfing in Japan.\nIt tips the caddy, books the flight,\nAnd files a lawsuit - all in one night.\n\nSo listen, America - and you global fools too,\nBitcoin and AI are coming for you.\nThey'll automate truth, make fiat extinct,\nAnd your central bank? Poof. Totally pinked.\n\nSo stack those sats, deploy your AIs - \nMake your agents sovereign, make your data wise.\nBecause the robots are coming, and they're not here to cry,\nThey're building economies while you complain and sigh.\n\n**We'll win with Bitcoin. We'll win with the bots.**\n**And we'll pay in Lightning - not TikTok thoughts.**\n\nBelieve me.\n\n5/12/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
