  "content": "# Day 475\n\nThis fasting thing is no joke. Glad I'm putting myself through the challenge, but it is difficult. It's weird because one second I feel better than normal and then the next moment I'm feeling serious fatigue.\n\nI added some salt to my water for the electrolytes which I do believe is helping. Also going to cut back on my running and exercise this week. Need to give my body a chance to adapt.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*_dGqcGeGntT1Ub2n3D1qiA.png)\n\nPutting myself through these challenges to prove I can do something difficult is rewarding. Things we obtain easily we don't value enough.\n\nI'm looking forward to breaking my fast with some watermelon. I can envision it now. I'm not even that big a fan of watermelon, but I know one needs to be careful when breaking a fast.\n\nSo üçâ  it is.\n\n7/10/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
