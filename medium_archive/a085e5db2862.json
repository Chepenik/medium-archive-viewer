We are talking about transmitting ideas here. Through a cryptographic medium most boomers don't get. One day I shall know I'm older when I don't understand the memes my children show me. When someone has to explain the meme to me which makes the meme unfunny in the process.\n\nIndeed, history repeats. It 'tis what it is.\n\nOn a much more important note I wrote this code tonight:\n\n![Screengrab in case of link rot one day!](https://miro.medium.com/1*q140NCwNrtJFdX0iEZFT4g.png)\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Freplit.com%2F%40ConorChepenik%2Fday-7100-days%3Fembed%3Dtrue&display_name=replit&url=https%3A%2F%2Freplit.com%2F%40ConorChepenik%2Fday-7100-days%3Fembed%3Dtrue&image=https%3A%2F%2Freplit.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Freplit-logo-800x600.png&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=replit\" title=\"\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\"></iframe>\n\nSimple yet fun. Proud of myself for completing week 1 of replit's 100 day coding challenge. 93 more days to go. LFG!\n\n8/8/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
