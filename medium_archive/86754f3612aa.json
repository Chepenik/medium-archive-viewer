  "content": "# Day 703\n\nI think I have walking pneumonia and almost fell asleep before reading and writing today. At the moment it is looking like I might not hit my goal of running 40.1 miles this month like I set out to do every month this year. Being sick sucks but I'm proud I didn't let myself fall asleep before reading and writing. Small wins. Going to keep today super short so I can catch up on my zzzzzzzzss but I think it's important that you don't let other goals go out the window because you don't hit one. Reading everyday has been amazing and I'm excited to see how The Fountainhead ends.\n\n2/23/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
