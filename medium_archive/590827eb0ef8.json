  "content": "# Day 966\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*MkkCKD6gsfmUlh3fEf7LxQ.png)\n\nIt's incredible that I carry a piece of glass in my pocket capable of creating an image of almost anything I can imagine. A tiny phone with more computing power than all the computers in Houston during the moon landing - pretty sure that's accurate. It makes me wildly optimistic about what humanity can achieve.\n\nI got a bit distracted while writing and opened another tab to Nostr. Ended up sending over 1k satoshis to random people on the internet I barely know - just fellow mutuals online. It's crazy, but in the best way. No KYC needed, yet it's essentially like handing cash to a stranger. I love Bitcoin, the internet, and the freedom technologies that make this possible.\n\nWe need more of them. I hope to build, support, and help people adopt these tools. To empower my friends, family, loved ones, and even strangers to use Bitcoin to better their lives.\n\nI've caught the Bitcoin mind virus, but trust me, it's the best kind of contagion. A monetary software upgrade that frees you from fiat - the currency of destruction, debasement, and decay. Pick the better currency. #Bitcoin\n\n11/12/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
