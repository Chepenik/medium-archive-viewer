  "content": "# Day 1150\n\nToday we made a pilgrimage through some of our favorite Boston spots, Cambridge, Somerville, and the North End, to celebrate my wife's birthday. Started the morning at **Bom Dough** in Cambridge (incredible coffee and breakfast), wandered through familiar streets before going to the park to play, and ended the day with **pizza and ice cream** in Boston's most Italian neighborhood. Can't go wrong with that.\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1923009113388199967](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1923009113388199967)](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZUNrObRLfc6GM8qH-7Aakg.png)\n\n![[https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1923033960809988139](https://x.com/ConorChepenik/status/1923033960809988139)](https://miro.medium.com/1*4eFIA6Sc5v-lqvgBD-TmFg.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Kv7XvYXR5OfRVwjWISJWpw.png)\n\nTraveling with a toddler is a whole different game than solo travel. Slower pace, more stops, but way more smiles. It was especially sweet watching **Sloan enjoy the city where she was born**. She even got to see her buddy Mateo, who used to live in the same apartment building when we lived here.\n\nIt was a full circle kind of day. I'm glad to be back in Florida to raise my kids, but Boston will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\n5/15/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
