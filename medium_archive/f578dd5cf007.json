The car feels like the future. Sleek lines, torque that slams you back like takeoff in a fighter jet, yet eerily quiet. But for a real road trip? Give me a gas guzzler all day. No timeouts. No nanny cams. Just vibes.\n\nI got slapped with an FSD time-out for _looking around_. Sorry, robot, I was in Atlanta. Glass monoliths everywhere. Hard not to gawk. But that's the weird thing, when the car's doing the driving, your brain wants to wander. Zoom out. Think big thoughts. Instead, you're forced to _pretend_ you're engaged. Like babysitting a toddler who thinks they're an adult. \"I got it, I got it!\" No, you don't.\n\nAlso the charging stops...Meh. Faster than before, but still not \"fill 'er up and bounce\" fast. My experience today driving a Tesla for 6+ hours: you're in this awkward limbo where not self-driving enough to check out, not gas-car fast enough to rip through a pit stop.\n\nAnd I guess that's the lesson I should internalize, **don't build in the middle.** Whether it's a car or software, either give people full control, or automate it flawlessly. That halfway limbo? It's a recipe for rage, a tease that leaves you grinding your teeth. That said I would not short Tesla anytime soon.\n\n![Tesla stock trading at $309.87 July 10 2025](https://miro.medium.com/1*aSCpndyzTp-8XHNZQcytaw.png)\n\nJust that when you build things it's worth it to be opinionated. And to be fair to Musk & the Tesla team they are literally building robo-taxis as I write so what I'm asking for should be here soon. No steering wheel, full nap-mode on I-95? Sign me up.\n\nBut I also love driving, windows down, foot on the gas, _feeling_ the freedom to drive how and wherever I want. It's this middle zone, this tease of freedom, that chaps my a$$.\n\nAnyway, I'm exhausted. 6 hours behind the wheel of tomorrow. At least I got to buc down at Buc-ee's on the way back home. The Brisket sandwhich was much needed.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*RQQmJNgd0ZfzZut7QQt1Ng.png)\n\n7/10/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
