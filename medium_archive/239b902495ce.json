The Fed also announced a CBDC pilot after this whole FTX fiasco and this meme killed me.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/braydensutton/status/1592574984840699904&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nAnd last but not least Russia has struck Poland. Honestly I've kind of been on the side of Russia in the sense it's BS the west prints money out of thin air to pay for their goods. I just want to avoid war at all costs and understand why Russia is upset with NATO and their expansion. Now I don't have much sympathy for Russia if they are going to try and take this fight to NATO countries. I hope war can be avoided but this is looking bleak.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1592591479763275776&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nAnyways, I'm kind of at a lack of words. My good friend Jackson said it best. \"It's laughable how fucked everything is\".\n\nI'm keeping the hope and know good will win out but oh my gosh. I'm just sitting here like the human experience is so crazy and it is damn near impossible to truly know best practices with technology. It's incredibly hard to discern truth in this world where we are all connected online and increasingly disconnected in person.\n\nIt has got to be about ideas, not people. Ideas can fix the world. People are prone to their own human error. Going to keep my head down, stay humble and stack sats. Bruce is right we got to end the idea of important people.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1592564295078137856&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n11/15/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik\n\nP.S I saw this tweet after posting today's Medium.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/jackposobiec/status/1592652426930434048&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nWhich just serves a reminder that I have no business taking sides. I will likely never know the truth and trying to figure it out can seem futile. I would gladly defend my family and property but _I have no desire to fight on behalf of a nation-state run by Kleptocrats_. I do love and support the U.S constitution but few members of our Government seem to so if anyone is wondering the part in italics is my new stance lmao.",
