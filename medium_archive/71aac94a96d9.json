  "content": "# Day 1143\n\nBitcoin vs S&P 500 - past 365 days. Normalized performance and rolling correlation tell a nice story. Let's talk volatility, decoupling, and why the ones who stomach the chaos are the ones who win.\n\nðŸ‘‡\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*8TDLAF2_7MoLAcfg)\n\nIn summer '24, Bitcoin lagged the S&P But in Q4, BTC went from ~90 to over 160 A 70% gain while the S&P cruised up 10â€“15% This is what \"asymmetric upside\" looks like. Volatility is not a bug... It's a feature of perfect money monetizing itself for the first time.\n\nThis is why most people underperform: They confuse volatility for risk. Volatility is emotional discomfort. Risk is not having enough Bitcoin when it matters. One feels bad. **The other is bad.**\n\nIf you're close to retirement, and have not studied what money is then yes stick with stocks, bonds, & real estate so you don't paper hands the pico bottom. But if you're young, liquid, and not made of soy? â†’ Stack BTC â†’ Buy the dips â†’ Zoom out â†’ Enjoy when it rips\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*O2ZbrKWjuGECqBFk)\n\nYou don't need a PhD to win. (In fact, if you've got one, you might mid-curve this.) You need balls. Bitcoin dumps? Good. Red days are entry points. Not exit plans. Stack like your future, and your kids' future, depends on it. Because it does.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*6GQg_NFTcutntgRR)\n\nIf you want to recreate the charts yourself, here's the exact notebook I used:\n\nGoogle Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VNjERqyEGe76Dovu8kt4Na7y1Hxx2lPJ?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VNjERqyEGe76Dovu8kt4Na7y1Hxx2lPJ?usp=sharing)\n\nExplore it. Fork it. Remix it. And if this Medium sparked something in you - keep going. Understanding Bitcoin changed my life. I hope it changes yours too.\n\nNone of this is financial advice. Do your own research (into Bitcoin) :)\n\n5/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
