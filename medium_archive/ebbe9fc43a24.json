I had originally reserved a tee time for a round of golf, but then a friend proposed an earlier game. At that point, I had two options: ignore my initial reservation or take the high road. I chose the latter and decided to call the golf course to cancel. The question that lingered was, \"What motivated me to cancel when it wasn't strictly necessary?\"\n\nUpon self-examination, I came to realize that my actions were rooted in moral principles deeply embedded in American values. In the same way I hope for considerate treatment from others, I strive to extend the same courtesy to those around me. If I were the proprietor of a small business, like a golf course, I would appreciate customers informing me if their plans changed instead of simply not showing up. This practice builds trust and fosters goodwill within the community. Though it took just a brief phone call to cancel, it felt like the right thing to do.\n\nEthical behavior begins with contemplating how our actions affect others. My decision to call and cancel was a mark of respect for the time and effort of the golf course employees. Leaving them in uncertainty, unsure if I would show up, would have been unfair. It is these small gestures of courtesy that act as the adhesive holding our communities together.\n\nThe United States' commitment to moral principles, such as honesty and respect, has long set us apart. While self-interest often drives human behavior, ethics challenge us to rise above it. Doing the right thing, even when no one is watching, is a testament to our national character.\n\nInstances like the one where I canceled my tee time are opportunities to align our actions with our ideals. Simple acts of consideration can strengthen relationships and reinforce the bonds that hold society together. Practicing ethics in our daily lives reaffirms America's core principles of freedom, justice, and human dignity.\n\nThe most pivotal moments often transpire when nobody is watching. I realize focusing on my seemingly minor act of canceling a tee-time could appear self-congratulatory. However, the true importance lies in the bigger picture. Daily, billions of people confront seemingly trivial choices that together mold our collective reality. Those tasked with making policies should approach lawmaking by reconsidering fundamentals and pondering how incentives factor crucially. Promoting constructive incentives and win-win scenarios at home can help us administer our institutions as efficiently as possible. As we embark as a nation on this course, we must uphold the Constitution and shared moral values as the guiding compass steering us toward the path of advancement.\n\n9/4/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
