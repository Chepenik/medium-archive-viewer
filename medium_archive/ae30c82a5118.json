  "content": "# Day 936\n\n**Bitcoin, Banter, and Brandon: The Green Candle Investments Show**\n\nIn a financial media landscape often dominated by dry analysis and sensationalism, [Brandon Keys](http://chatgpt.com/c/670b0c96-3038-8009-a83c-576498a8fd9d)' of the Green Candle Investments Show offers a refreshingly straightforward approach to discussing Bitcoin and macro topics. With its focus on education, debate, and expert insights, the show has quickly established itself as a go-to destination for those looking to stay informed about the world of digital assets.\n\nBrandon's journey into the world of Bitcoin began, like many others, through podcasts. Inspired by shows like \"We Study Billionaires\" hosted by Preston Pysh, Brandon found himself diving deep into the rabbit hole of digital assets and personal finance. As he shared his newfound knowledge with friends, he realized there was a need for content that could break down complex financial topics in an accessible way.\n\n\"I've always found a bunch of content was pretty complex in the financial world and in the Bitcoin space,\" Brandon explains. \"All these complex topics, it was kind of intimidating.\" With an engineering background, Brandon felt he could offer a unique perspective, translating intricate concepts into language that anyone could understand.\n\nWhat sets Green Candle apart is its broad appeal. While Bitcoin is a core focus, Brandon's vision extends beyond the orange coin. \"I didn't want to include Bitcoin in the name because I wanted anybody who related to finance to come in that way, and then I'll be able to backdoor orange pill them in some way, shape, or form,\" he says. This strategy has allowed Green Candle to attract a diverse audience, from Bitcoin enthusiasts to those just starting their financial journey.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Green Candle's growth has been its ability to attract high-profile guests. [Brandon's interview with Jack Mallers](https://youtu.be/ttS-hqHiHzo) was a pivotal moment, helping to catapult the podcast forward. But it's the unexpected crossovers that really excite Brandon. \"I'm a huge sports fan,\" he says. \"I've interviewed Vince Beagle, and I'm trying to interview some more athletes.\" This intersection of sports and finance is an area Brandon is particularly passionate about exploring further.\n\nBrandon's success in securing notable guests comes from his dedication to networking and attending conferences. \"If you go to them, you meet them in person, then when you do an outreach, it's not a cold outreach anymore, it's a warm outreach,\" he advises. This personal approach has opened doors and created opportunities that might not have been possible through digital interactions alone.\n\nLooking ahead, Brandon has big plans for Green Candle. \"I want green candles everywhere,\" he says, hinting at a multi-platform approach to content creation. His vision is to make Green Candle the \"Barstool of Finance,\" where people can laugh but also learn about Bitcoin and its implications for the future of money.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//x.com/Greencandleit/status/1803835971756040250&image=\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\n![[https://x.com/Greencandleit/status/1803861088494391447](https://x.com/Greencandleit/status/1803861088494391447)](https://miro.medium.com/0*7Cv7NejYwq7MGHdg)\n\nBrandon aims to expand the podcast's reach by bringing in financial influencers from various niches, including real estate and traditional finance. By exposing these influencers and their audiences to Bitcoin, he hopes to continue growing the Bitcoin community. \"I really see it more as how I'm going to develop the content side of things. I really want to make it overarching around finance, making it funny and accessible.,\" Brandon explains.\n\nFor those looking to follow in Green Candle's footsteps, Brandon offers some sage advice: \"Don't be afraid to try to ask people for advice, help, all that kind of stuff. Utilize resources, see what other people are doing not just in the Bitcoin space, but in alternative spaces that are working.\" He emphasizes the importance of focusing on one platform initially before expanding to others and being willing to invest in yourself.\n\nWith its mix of education, entertainment, and high-profile guests, Green Candle is positioning itself as a go-to source for Bitcoin insights in the digital age. Whether you're a seasoned Bitcoin veteran or just starting to explore the world of finance, Green Candle offers something for everyone.\n\nAs people increasingly lose trust in legacy corporate media, the importance of independent voices cannot be overstated. Brandon's work with Green Candle is a shining example of this, bringing Bitcoin education to the masses through a unique blend of traditional finance, sports, and digital asset expertise. By breaking down complex concepts into easily digestible content, Green Candle is helping to bridge the knowledge gap and drive Bitcoin adoption.\n\nFollow Green Candle on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GreenCandle) and [X (Formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/Greencandleit) to stay up to date with the latest episodes and insights from Brandon and his guests.\n\n10/13/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
