  "content": "# Day 247\n\nIt's been an incredible Thanksgiving so far. I enjoyed spending the day with my girlfriend and soon to be daughter. Also had my girl shave my head. While I do love my flow she was saying it looked to feminine. So I literally took out my trimmer and buzzed off a chunk. At which point my girl had to shave the rest. It does feel a lot lighter. Colder as well but that's okay I can wear a winter cap.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*dyWQk7phYmYDcDfKL6ZwyQ.jpeg)\n\nIn other news clown world seems to not be stopping any time soon.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1595889743958798336&image=https%3A//i.embed.ly/1/image%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fabs.twimg.com%252Ferrors%252Flogo46x38.png%26key%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\" title=\"\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n\nI don't even know what to say at this point. I'm grateful that I can see through the bullshit? Anyways, until tomorrow anon. Going to enjoy the rest of the holidays with those I love!\n\n11/24/22\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
