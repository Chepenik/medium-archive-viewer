  "content": "# Day 1072\n\nToday I savored some ice cream with my daughter Sloan before embarking on a peaceful evening walk. She's growing up so quickly, and our conversations continue to amaze me. Her personality shines brighter each day, and right now she's beside me, tiny fingers attempting to join mine on the keyboard.\n\nThere's something profoundly moving about witnessing your child evolve into their own person. Earlier today, I downloaded the Grok app, and in the sweetest voice Sloan declared, \"I want ChatGPT!\" The moment was precious. When I opened Chat and shared this with it, its remarkably human-like laughter surprised me. It's astonishing how rapidly these AI tools are advancing. I'm incredibly optimistic about what the future holds for us all.\n\n![[https://x.com/iruletheworldmo/status/1894509198236422623](https://x.com/iruletheworldmo/status/1894509198236422623)](https://miro.medium.com/1*mBiEjJB9oHNRH0AvJXczUA.png)\n\nI want more free time to spend with my family, to do what I want when I want, and to have absolute control over my time. Patience, I am telling myself right now because I know it's on the horizon. A couple more years and between Bitcoin & AI I'll own all my time and only do the things I want. That said, I'm grateful for the ability to work in the Bitcoin space, but nothing beats complete autonomy in how you move throughout the day. Soon. I'm manifesting abundance and I know for a fact it's coming. Be patient. God rewards those who trust the process every time.\n\n2/26/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
