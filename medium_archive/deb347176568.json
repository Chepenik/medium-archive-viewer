  "content": "# Day 431\n\nSomeone hired me to build a website for them. Man does that feel good. Life is often getting kicked in the teeth, but when you succeed it makes every beating worth it. Hahahaha maybe that is a bit harsh for an analogy but you get the point. Living is a grind. Bills, bullshit, and all the other stuff adults must deal with on a day to day basis. That's why having a kid has been so special for me. Watching Sloan find amusement in the most random things is beautiful. If I died tomorrow I don't think my final thoughts would be about all the chores I did not complete.\n\nOur energy is scarce. Of course I will have to make time to pay my bills and everything else, but I'm fortunate to get to relearn things via my kid. Today I got to catch up with my buddy, The Bom Taker, and afterwards I just went and touched grass with Sloan. It was amazing. My buddy lives in the big apple and he reminded me how important it is to touch grass. We laughed because he said while he tries to touch grass often he could not have picked a worse city for doing so. It happens. New York City is still a good time.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*FwkcG3xjW-tcl24L)\n\nAnyways, that is all for today. I'm going to go enjoy myself. Grateful to have my health, family, and friends. Been a nice lowkey Saturday and I appreciate the Universe hooking me up with this fine day in May!\n\n5/27/23\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
