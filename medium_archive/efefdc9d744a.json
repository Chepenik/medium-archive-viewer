How do we stop caring about other people's approval? How do we stop chasing money, power, and fame? The answer is simple but not easy: learn to love yourself. We must look inward instead of outward to find validation.\n\nWe can never make other people truly happy because we are not them. Humans are remarkably skilled at concealing their true intentions, sometimes even from themselves. Often, our subconscious thoughts and emotions go unexamined, leaving us unaware of what we truly want or need. The best way to help others find happiness is by focusing on your own. Joy is contagious, and the easiest way to spread it is by being joyful yourself.\n\nHappy people naturally uplift those around them. It might seem paradoxical, but the best way to make the world a better place is to start by working on yourself. Misery attracts misery, but fulfillment draws in others who are fulfilled. When you radiate positivity, it creates a ripple effect, inspiring others to find their own happiness.\n\nKarma, vibes, energy - call it whatever you want. You attract what you are. So, work on becoming a powerful force for good. When you do that, you will not only make your own life better, but you will also make the world better.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/0*NSEcp2WR4G4FWbox)\n\n11/23/24\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
