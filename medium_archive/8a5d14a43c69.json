What do you think happens next?!?!?!?!?!?!?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/1*Xk3hDpl0rOaxxgR1UsAgVA.png)\n\nI'm so grateful to witness my country embrace sound money. Despite all the challenges the USA faces, we've nailed two things: our beautiful Constitution and now this bold step toward embracing Bitcoin. The future looks incredibly BRIGHT ORANGE.\n\n3/8/25\n\nConor Jay Chepenik",
